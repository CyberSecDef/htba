---

## Executive Summary

The information gathering assessment of `inlanefreight.htb` revealed several security concerns that warrant immediate attention. Through systematic reconnaissance, the assessment team discovered **exposed API keys**, **hidden administrative directories**, **sensitive email addresses**, and **future API credentials embedded in HTML comments**.

### Key Findings Summary

| Severity | Finding | Location |
| -------- | ------- | -------- |
| **HIGH** | Exposed API Key in Hidden Admin Directory | `http://web1337.inlanefreight.htb:37666/admin_h1dd3n/` |
| **HIGH** | Future API Key Disclosed in HTML Comment | `http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778/` (spider results) |
| **MEDIUM** | Sensitive robots.txt Disclosures | `http://web1337.inlanefreight.htb:37666/robots.txt` |
| **MEDIUM** | Missing Security Headers | All virtual hosts |
| **LOW** | Email Address Disclosure | `1337testing@inlanefreight.htb` via web crawling |
| **INFO** | Multiple Virtual Hosts Discovered | `web1337.inlanefreight.htb`, `dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb` |

**[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]:** The discovery of exposed API keys represents a critical security gap. API keys provide programmatic access to backend services and, if compromised, could allow unauthorized access to sensitive functionality. The presence of a development subdomain (`dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb`) with embedded comments containing future credentials suggests inadequate code review practices and a lack of secrets management.

### Next Steps

1. **Immediate:** Rotate all exposed API keys (`e963d863ee0e82ba7080fbf558ca0d3f` and `ba988b835be4aa97d068941dc852ff33`)
2. **Short-term:** Implement proper secrets management and remove hardcoded credentials from source code
3. **Short-term:** Configure security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options) on all web servers
4. **Medium-term:** Restrict access to development environments and administrative directories
5. **Medium-term:** Implement a robots.txt review process to prevent disclosure of sensitive paths

### Caveats

- **[CAVEAT]:** This assessment was limited to information gathering only; no exploitation or active attacks were performed
- **[CAVEAT]:** The nmap scan against `inlanefreight.htb` resolved to the HTB lab infrastructure (83.136.249.34) but showed results from ports 44443 and 50000 which may indicate a different target host configuration; the primary assessment was conducted on ports 37666 and 34778 as specified in scope
- **[CAVEAT]:** WHOIS lookup for the `.htb` TLD is not supported as it is a non-routable/lab domain; WHOIS data was gathered from the production `inlanefreight.com` domain for reference
- **[CAVEAT]:** Performance metrics are derived from scan tool outputs where available

### Risk Categories and Rationales

| Risk Level | Description | Rationale |
| ---------- | ----------- | --------- |
| **HIGH** | Immediate remediation required | Exposed credentials that could lead to unauthorized access |
| **MEDIUM** | Remediation within 30 days | Security misconfigurations that increase attack surface |
| **LOW** | Remediation within 90 days | Information disclosure with limited direct impact |
| **INFO** | Informational | Findings that provide useful context but require no action |

## Recommended Actions

| ID | Vulnerability Title | Recommended Action | Risk Category |
| -- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Exposed API Key in Admin Directory | Immediately rotate the API key `e963d863ee0e82ba7080fbf558ca0d3f` and restrict access to `/admin_h1dd3n/` | HIGH |
| 2 | Future API Key in HTML Comment | Remove the comment containing `ba988b835be4aa97d068941dc852ff33` from source code; do not use this key in production | HIGH |
| 3 | Sensitive Paths in robots.txt | Review robots.txt entries; consider authentication for admin paths; do not rely on robots.txt for security | MEDIUM |
| 4 | Missing X-Frame-Options Header | Configure `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` on all nginx virtual hosts | MEDIUM |
| 5 | Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header | Configure `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` on all nginx virtual hosts | MEDIUM |
| 6 | Email Address Disclosure | Review web content for exposed email addresses; implement email obfuscation if needed | LOW |
| 7 | Development Subdomain Accessible | Restrict access to `dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb` via IP whitelisting or VPN | MEDIUM |

## Technical Findings

---

### Section 1: Domain and Infrastructure Reconnaissance

#### Background

Domain reconnaissance is the initial phase of information gathering where publicly available information about the target organization is collected. This includes WHOIS records, DNS information, and domain registration details. Such information can reveal the registrar, name servers, creation/expiry dates, and administrative contacts.

#### Details

##### WHOIS Lookup Results

**[SOURCE: scans/final_recon.log]**

The FinalRecon tool was used to perform a WHOIS lookup on the production domain `inlanefreight.com`:

| Field | Value |
| ----- | ----- |
| Domain Name | INLANEFREIGHT.COM |
| Registry Domain ID | 2420436757_DOMAIN_COM-VRSN |
| Registrar | Amazon Registrar, Inc. |
| **Registrar IANA ID** | **468** |
| Registrar WHOIS Server | whois.registrar.amazon |
| Registrar URL | http://registrar.amazon.com |
| Creation Date | 2019-08-05T22:43:09Z |
| Updated Date | 2025-07-01T22:45:43Z |
| Registry Expiry Date | 2026-08-05T22:43:09Z |
| Name Servers | NS-1303.AWSDNS-34.ORG, NS-1580.AWSDNS-05.CO.UK, NS-161.AWSDNS-20.COM, NS-671.AWSDNS-19.NET |
| DNSSEC | unsigned |
| Domain Status | clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited |

**[FINDING]:** The registrar IANA ID is **468** (Amazon Registrar, Inc.)

**[SOURCE: scans/final_recon.log]** - The tool exported results to `/home/kali/.local/share/finalrecon/dumps/fr_inlanefreight.com_03-01-2026_19:14:43`

##### Production Domain Headers

**[SOURCE: scans/final_recon.log]**

Headers retrieved from `http://inlanefreight.com`:

```
Date : Sun, 04 Jan 2026 00:14:44 GMT
Server : Apache/2.4.41 (Ubuntu)
Link : <https://www.inlanefreight.com/index.php/wp-json/>; rel="https://api.w.org/"
Vary : Accept-Encoding
Content-Encoding : gzip
Content-Type : text/html; charset=UTF-8
```

**[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]:** The production domain runs on Apache/2.4.41 on Ubuntu and appears to use WordPress (indicated by the `wp-json` API endpoint). This is a different technology stack than the lab target which uses nginx.

##### Lab Target Infrastructure

**[SOURCE: scans/nmap.log]**

The nmap scan revealed the following infrastructure details for the target:

| Attribute | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Target IP | 83.136.249.34 |
| Operating System | Linux (kernel 5.0 - 5.14, 96% confidence) |
| Internal Host Reference | 192.168.94.62 |
| Network Distance | 15 hops |
| Geographic Route | Via Cogent network through London (lhr01) |

#### Risk Analysis

**[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]:** The WHOIS information reveals standard domain registration through Amazon Registrar with proper domain locking (clientDeleteProhibited, clientTransferProhibited, clientUpdateProhibited). The domain is set to expire on August 5, 2026. The use of AWS DNS name servers indicates cloud infrastructure dependency. No immediate risks identified from domain registration data.

#### Recommendation

1. Ensure domain registration is monitored for expiry to prevent domain hijacking
2. Consider enabling DNSSEC for additional DNS security
3. Maintain up-to-date registrar contact information

### Section 2: Web Server Fingerprinting and Virtual Host Discovery

#### Background

Web server fingerprinting identifies the software and versions running on target servers. Virtual host enumeration discovers additional websites hosted on the same IP address but responding to different Host headers. These techniques expand the attack surface and may reveal development or staging environments.

#### Details

##### HTTP Server Identification

**[SOURCE: scans/whatweb.log, scans/curl.log, scans/final_recon.log]**

Multiple tools confirmed the web server software:

| Virtual Host | Server Software | Version | Port | Source |
| ------------ | --------------- | ------- | ---- | ------ |
| inlanefreight.htb | **nginx** | 1.26.1 | 37666 | whatweb.log |
| web1337.inlanefreight.htb | nginx | 1.26.1 | 34778 | whatweb.log |
| dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb | nginx | 1.26.1 | 34778 | whatweb.log |

**[FINDING]:** The HTTP server software is **nginx**

**Curl Header Verification [SOURCE: scans/curl.log]:**
```
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Server: nginx/1.26.1

Content-Type: text/html
Content-Length: 120
Last-Modified: Thu, 01 Aug 2024 09:35:23 GMT
```

##### Virtual Host Discovery

**[SOURCE: scans/gobuster.log]**

Gobuster was used in VHOST mode to enumerate virtual hosts using the `subdomains-top1million-110000.txt` wordlist:

**Scan 1 - Base Domain Enumeration:**

- Requests: 1297 (0 errors, 5 items reported)

**dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778:**
- Start Time: 2026-01-03 20:33:46
- End Time: 2026-01-03 20:35:53 (127 seconds)
- Server: nginx/1.26.1
- **Finding:** Missing X-Frame-Options header
- **Finding:** Missing X-Content-Type-Options header
- Requests: 1377 (0 errors, 2 items reported)

##### Hidden Admin Directory Discovery

**[SOURCE: scans/nikto.log, scans/curl.log]**

Nikto identified a robots.txt file on `web1337.inlanefreight.htb` containing sensitive path disclosures:

**robots.txt entries found:**
- `/index.html` - Returned HTTP 200
- `/admin_h1dd3n/` - Returned HTTP 200 (Hidden Admin Directory)

**[SOURCE: scans/curl.log]**

Manual verification via curl:
```bash
$ curl http://web1337.inlanefreight.htb:37666/admin_h1dd3n/
```

**Response:**
```html
<!DOCTYPE html><html><head><title>web1337 admin</title></head><body>
<h1>Welcome to web1337 admin site</h1>
<h2>The admin panel is currently under maintenance, but the API is still accessible with the key e963d863ee0e82ba7080fbf558ca0d3f</h2>
</body></html>
```

**[FINDING - HIGH SEVERITY]:** API key exposed in hidden admin directory: **e963d863ee0e82ba7080fbf558ca0d3f**

#### Risk Analysis

**[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]:**

1. **Missing Security Headers (MEDIUM):** The absence of `X-Frame-Options` and `X-Content-Type-Options` headers on all virtual hosts exposes the applications to clickjacking attacks and MIME-type confusion attacks respectively.

2. **Exposed Admin Directory (HIGH):** The `/admin_h1dd3n/` directory is indexed in robots.txt and publicly accessible, violating the principle of security through obscurity. More critically, it exposes an active API key.

3. **No WAF Protection (INFO):** The lack of WAF means there is no additional layer of protection against common web attacks (SQLi, XSS, etc.).

4. **Development Environment Accessible (MEDIUM):** The `dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb` subdomain is accessible from the internet, potentially exposing unfinished or vulnerable code.

#### Recommendation

1. Implement security headers via nginx configuration:
   ```nginx
   add_header X-Frame-Options "DENY" always;
   add_header X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff" always;
   add_header X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block" always;
   ```
2. Remove sensitive paths from robots.txt or implement authentication
3. Immediately rotate the exposed API key
4. Implement IP-based access restrictions for admin directories
5. Consider implementing a WAF (e.g., ModSecurity, AWS WAF, Cloudflare)
6. Restrict development environments to internal networks or VPN

### Section 3: Web Application Crawling and Sensitive Data Discovery

#### Background

Web crawling (spidering) systematically browses web applications to discover content, links, forms, and embedded data. This phase often reveals email addresses, comments, hidden files, and other sensitive information not immediately visible to casual visitors.

#### Details

##### Web Spidering with ReconSpider

**[SOURCE: scans/recon_spider.log, scans/spider_results.json]**

ReconSpider (Scrapy-based) was executed against `http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778`:

**Scan Metrics [SOURCE: scans/recon_spider.log]:**
| Metric | Value |
| ------ | ----- |
| Start Time | 2026-01-03 20:21:21 |
| End Time | 2026-01-03 20:21:41 |
| Elapsed Time | 19.498102 seconds |
| Pages Crawled | 100 |
| Responses per Minute | 315.79 |
| Request Depth Max | 99 |
| Downloader Request Bytes | 31,699 |
| Downloader Response Bytes | 34,117 |
| Memory Usage | 69,771,264 bytes (max) |
| Finish Reason | finished |

**Scrapy Version:** 2.13.4
**Python Version:** 3.13.11

##### Spider Results Analysis

**[SOURCE: scans/spider_results.json]**

The spider extracted the following data:

**Emails Discovered:**
```json
"emails": [
    "1337testing@inlanefreight.htb"
]
```

**[FINDING]:** Email address discovered: **1337testing@inlanefreight.htb**

**HTML Comments Discovered:**
```json
"comments": [
    "<!-- Remember to change the API key to ba988b835be4aa97d068941dc852ff33 -->"
]
```

**[FINDING - HIGH SEVERITY]:** Future API key disclosed in HTML comment: **ba988b835be4aa97d068941dc852ff33**

**Links Discovered:**
The spider discovered 99 pages following a pattern of `index-{N}.html` where N ranges from 24 to 1000:
- `http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778/index-525.html`
- `http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778/index-458.html`
- ... (99 additional pages discovered)
- `http://dev.web1337.inlanefreight.htb:34778/index-1000.html`

**Other Extracted Data:**
| Category | Count |
| -------- | ----- |
| External Files | 0 |
| JavaScript Files | 0 |
| Form Fields | 0 |
| Images | 0 |
| Videos | 0 |
| Audio | 0 |

#### Risk Analysis

**[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]:**

1. **HTML Comment with API Key (HIGH):** Developers have left a comment in the source code indicating a planned API key change. This represents:
   - A secret management failure
   - Potential credential pre-disclosure before rotation
   - Evidence of poor code review practices

2. **Email Address Disclosure (LOW):** The email `1337testing@inlanefreight.htb` appears to be a testing account. While low-risk directly, it could be used for:
   - Social engineering attacks
   - Password spray/brute-force attacks
   - Phishing campaigns

3. **Development Environment Exposure (MEDIUM):** The development site with 100+ pages accessible from the internet increases attack surface significantly.

#### Recommendation

1. **Immediately remove HTML comments containing sensitive data from all environments**
2. Implement pre-commit hooks to scan for secrets/credentials in source code
3. Use environment variables or secrets management solutions (Vault, AWS Secrets Manager) instead of hardcoding credentials
4. Implement a code review process specifically checking for sensitive data leakage
5. Consider using email aliases for testing rather than internal addresses
6. Restrict development environments from public access
