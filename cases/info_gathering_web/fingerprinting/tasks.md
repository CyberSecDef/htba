## Tasks

- We are currently working on the Fingerprinting Test Case.  This can be found at ./cases/info_gathering_web/fingerprinting/*.  Please confirm understanding.  please only confirm understanding, we are going to run through this step by step.

- Generate a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  
All actions, logs, scans and such are in the folder: ./cases/info_gathering_web/fingerprinting/*
Ensure you read them all as some were generated by me.
Generate as robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the ./cases/info_gathering_web/fingerprinting/* folder and subfolders.  
Fill in details and descriptions and paragraphs as needed from the specific case folder and external research, but do not fabricate any 'facts' without stating so.  Any performance metrics should be found in the logs/scans or not referenced.
For every subsection, or referenced data point, cite which log and where the data came from.
For all infered sections or walkthrough, label them as such.
For all self generated code or actions, label them as such.
Any and all claims must be based in a logged fact/evidence or labeled as inferred/assumed/etc.
Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations.
Also create event walkthroughs stepping through each step taken in detail during this event.
make it clear in the report what took place in section 1, section 2 and section 3
Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/info_gathering_web/fingerprinting/fingerprinting_pentest_report.md
