## Introduction

This penetration testing report documents the web application fingerprinting assessment conducted against the Inlanefreight infrastructure. The primary objective was to identify the web server software, content management system (CMS), and underlying operating system running on the target virtual hosts.

### Scope and Duration

| Parameter | Details |
| --------- | ------- |
| **Assessment Date** | January 3, 2026 |
| **Target IP Address** | 10.129.132.123 |
| **Virtual Hosts Tested** | app.inlanefreight.local, dev.inlanefreight.local |
| **Assessment Type** | External Web Application Fingerprinting |
| **Duration** | Single session (~15 minutes of active scanning based on Nikto timestamps) |

*[Source: tasks.md - Target and Virtual Host definitions; scans/nikto.log - timing data]*

### Scenarios Included

- **HTTP Header Reconnaissance** - Analysis of HTTP response headers to identify server software and version
- **Port and Service Scanning** - Network enumeration to discover open ports and running services
- **Web Application Fingerprinting** - Technology stack identification including CMS, frameworks, and libraries
- **Web Application Firewall (WAF) Detection** - Assessment of protective security measures
- **Vulnerability Scanning** - Identification of potential security misconfigurations

### Targets

| Target | Type | IP Address |
| ------ | ---- | ---------- |
| app.inlanefreight.local | Virtual Host (Production Application) | 10.129.132.123 |
| dev.inlanefreight.local | Virtual Host (Development Environment) | 10.129.132.123 |

*[Source: tasks.md - lines 1-5]*

## Executive Summary

The fingerprinting assessment of the Inlanefreight web infrastructure successfully identified the complete technology stack across both virtual hosts. Both `app.inlanefreight.local` and `dev.inlanefreight.local` resolve to the same IP address (10.129.132.123) and are hosted on a shared XXXXXX Linux server running **Apache X.X.X** with the **XXXXXX! Content Management System**.

### Key Findings Summary

| Finding | Severity | Details |
| ------- | -------- | ------- |
| Outdated Apache Version | **Medium** | Apache X.X.X is outdated (current stable: 2.4.54+) |
| Missing Security Headers | **Low-Medium** | X-Frame-Options and X-Content-Type-Options headers absent |
| Exposed Directory Structure | **Low** | robots.txt reveals 14+ internal paths |
| No WAF Detected | **Informational** | No Web Application Firewall protecting either virtual host |
| XXXXXX! CMS Identified | **Informational** | CMS fingerprint exposed via meta generator tag |

### Next Steps

The organization should prioritize the following actions:

1. **Immediate**: Update Apache HTTP Server to the latest stable release (2.4.54 or later)
2. **Short-term**: Implement missing security headers (X-Frame-Options, X-Content-Type-Options, Content-Security-Policy)
3. **Short-term**: Review and restrict robots.txt entries to prevent information disclosure
4. **Medium-term**: Evaluate deployment of a Web Application Firewall (WAF)
5. **Medium-term**: Ensure XXXXXX! CMS is updated to the latest version and security patches applied

*[ANALYSIS/RECOMMENDATION: These next steps are expert recommendations based on the identified findings]*

### Caveats

- This assessment was limited to **fingerprinting and reconnaissance only**; no exploitation was attempted
- The assessment was conducted from an external perspective without authentication
- Both virtual hosts resolve to the same IP, indicating a shared hosting configuration
- The logs folder was empty; all findings are derived solely from the scan outputs in `/scans/`
- Specific XXXXXX! version could not be determined from the available scan data

### Risk Categories and Rationales

| Risk Category | Definition | Rationale |
| ------------- | ---------- | --------- |
| **Critical** | Immediate exploitation possible with severe impact | N/A for this assessment |
| **High** | Significant vulnerability with potential for major compromise | N/A for this assessment |
| **Medium** | Known vulnerabilities or outdated software with available patches | Apache X.X.X has known CVEs |
| **Low** | Security weaknesses that could aid reconnaissance or minor attacks | Missing headers, information disclosure |
| **Informational** | Notable observations without direct security impact | Technology stack identification |

---

## Recommended Actions

| ID | Vulnerability Title | Recommended Action | Risk Category |
| -- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Outdated Apache HTTP Server (X.X.X) | Upgrade to Apache 2.4.54 or later; establish patch management process | Medium |
| 2 | Missing X-Frame-Options Header | Add `X-Frame-Options: DENY` or `SAMEORIGIN` to Apache configuration | Low-Medium |
| 3 | Missing X-Content-Type-Options Header | Add `X-Content-Type-Options: nosniff` to Apache configuration | Low-Medium |
| 4 | Excessive robots.txt Disclosure | Review and minimize robots.txt entries; consider blocking sensitive paths at server level | Low |
| 5 | No Web Application Firewall | Evaluate and deploy a WAF solution (e.g., ModSecurity, Cloudflare, AWS WAF) | Low |
| 6 | CMS Fingerprinting Possible | Remove or obfuscate XXXXXX! generator meta tag; keep CMS updated | Informational |

*[ANALYSIS/RECOMMENDATION: Action items derived from scan findings with expert security guidance]*

## Technical Findings

### Section 1: HTTP Header Analysis (curl)

#### Background

HTTP header analysis using `curl -I` retrieves the response headers from a web server without downloading the full page content. This technique reveals server software, version information, cookie settings, and caching policies.

#### Details

**Scan Executed:** `curl -I http://app.inlanefreight.local` and `curl -I http://dev.inlanefreight.local`
*[Source: scans/curl.log]*

##### app.inlanefreight.local Response Headers

| Header | Value | Analysis |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| HTTP Status | `200 OK` | Server is responding normally |
| Date | `Sat, 03 Jan 2026 22:38:29 GMT` | Timestamp of request |
| **Server** | `Apache/X.X.X (XXXXXX)` | **FINDING: Apache version and OS exposed** |
| Set-Cookie | `72af8f2b24261272e581a49f5c56de40=mh56p3i1fnohv7ebrbnimoh89a; path=/; HttpOnly` | Session cookie with HttpOnly flag (good practice) |
| Permissions-Policy | `interest-cohort=()` | FLoC opted out |
| Cache-Control | `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0` | Dynamic content caching disabled |
| Content-Type | `text/html; charset=utf-8` | UTF-8 HTML response |

*[Source: scans/curl.log - lines 4-14]*

##### dev.inlanefreight.local Response Headers

| Header | Value | Analysis |
| ------ | ----- | -------- |
| HTTP Status | `200 OK` | Server is responding normally |
| Date | `Sat, 03 Jan 2026 22:38:42 GMT` | Timestamp of request |
| **Server** | `Apache/X.X.X (XXXXXX)` | **FINDING: Same Apache version/OS as app vhost** |
| Set-Cookie | `02a93f6429c54209e06c64b77be2180d=kcokrdh5briftecvbqburn6bba; path=/; HttpOnly` | Different session cookie (different XXXXXX instance) |
| Cache-Control | `no-store, no-cache, must-revalidate, post-check=0, pre-check=0` | Dynamic content caching disabled |

*[Source: scans/curl.log - lines 18-27]*

#### Risk Analysis

**FINDING:** The `Server` header explicitly exposes:
- **Web Server Software:** Apache HTTP Server
- **Version:** X.X.X
- **Operating System:** XXXXXX

This information disclosure allows attackers to research known vulnerabilities specific to Apache X.X.X on XXXXXX systems. Apache X.X.X was released in August 2019 and has multiple known CVEs including potential path traversal and request smuggling vulnerabilities.

*[ANALYSIS: Risk interpretation based on version disclosure pattern]*

#### Recommendation

1. Configure Apache to minimize version disclosure:
   ```apache
   ServerTokens Prod
   ServerSignature Off
   ```
2. Upgrade Apache to the latest stable release

*[SELF-GENERATED: Configuration recommendations based on Apache best practices]*

---

### Section 2: Port and Service Enumeration (Nmap)

#### Background

Nmap service version detection (`-sV`) and default script scanning (`-sC`) provides comprehensive port enumeration and service fingerprinting capabilities. This phase identifies all accessible network services and their versions.

#### Details

**Scans Executed:** 
- `nmap -sC -sV app.inlanefreight.local` (completed in 9.08 seconds)
- `nmap -sC -sV dev.inlanefreight.local` (completed in 9.43 seconds)

*[Source: scans/nmap.log]*

##### Open Ports and Services (Both Virtual Hosts)

| Port | State | Service | Version | Details |
| ---- | ----- | ------- | ------- | ------- |
| 22/tcp | open | SSH | OpenSSH 8.2p1 XXXXXX 4XXXXXX0.3 | XXXXXX Linux; protocol 2.0 |
| 80/tcp | open | HTTP | Apache httpd X.X.X | (XXXXXX) |

*[Source: scans/nmap.log - lines 6-17 and 27-38]*

##### SSH Host Keys Detected

| Algorithm | Fingerprint |
| --------- | ----------- |
| RSA (3072-bit) | `3f:4c:8f:10:f1:ae:be:cd:31:24:7c:a1:4e:ab:84:6d` |
| ECDSA (256-bit) | `7b:30:37:67:50:b9:ad:91:c0:8f:f7:02:78:3b:7c:02` |
| ED25519 (256-bit) | `88:9e:0e:07:fe:ca:d0:5c:60:ab:cf:10:99:cd:6c:a7` |

*[Source: scans/nmap.log - lines 8-11]*

##### HTTP Robots.txt Enumeration (Nmap http-robots.txt script)

The Nmap script identified 15 disallowed entries in robots.txt:

```
/XXXXXX/administrator/ /administrator/ /bin/ /cache/ 
/cli/ /components/ /includes/ /installation/ /language/ 
/layouts/ /libraries/ /logs/ /modules/ /plugins/ /tmp/
```

*[Source: scans/nmap.log - lines 14-16]*

##### CMS Detection (Nmap http-generator script)

| Virtual Host | Generator Tag Value |
| ------------ | ------------------- |
| app.inlanefreight.local | `XXXXXX! - Open Source Content Management` |
| dev.inlanefreight.local | `XXXXXX! - Open Source Content Management` |

*[Source: scans/nmap.log - lines 13 and 37]*

#### Risk Analysis

**FINDINGS:**

1. **SSH Service (Port 22):** OpenSSH 8.2p1 is a relatively modern version but XXXXXX 4XXXXXX0.3 indicates specific patch level. This version should be verified against current CVE databases.

2. **XXXXXX! CMS Detected:** The `http-generator` script positively identified XXXXXX! CMS on both virtual hosts. This is a critical finding for answering assessment Question 2.

3. **Robots.txt Disclosure:** The extensive robots.txt reveals the internal directory structure typical of XXXXXX! installations, including:
   - `/administrator/` - Admin panel location
   - `/installation/` - Potentially dangerous if accessible
   - `/tmp/` and `/cache/` - Could contain sensitive cached data
   - `/logs/` - Could expose error logs

4. **Reverse DNS:** The scan of `dev.inlanefreight.local` shows an rDNS record pointing to `app.inlanefreight.local`, confirming both hostnames resolve to 10.129.132.123

*[ANALYSIS: Interpretation of Nmap findings with security context]*

#### Recommendation

1. Verify the `/installation/` directory is not accessible (should return 403/404)
2. Ensure SSH is protected with key-based authentication and fail2ban
3. Review all robots.txt entries and consider server-level access restrictions

*[SELF-GENERATED: Recommendations based on security best practices]*

| IP | 10.129.132.123 |
| JQuery | Detected |
| MetaGenerator | **XXXXXX! - Open Source Content Management** |
| OpenSearch | `/index.php/component/search/` endpoint exposed |

*[Source: scans/whatweb.log - lines 7-8]*

**Key Observation:** The `HTTPServer` field explicitly identifies the operating system as **XXXXXX Linux**. This directly answers assessment Question 3.

##### Nikto Vulnerability Scan Results

**Scans Executed:** 
- `nikto -h app.inlanefreight.local -Tuning b` (45 seconds, 1412 requests)
- `nikto -h dev.inlanefreight.local -Tuning b` (47 seconds, 1412 requests)

*[Source: scans/nikto.log]*

###### Vulnerabilities and Findings (Both Hosts)

| Finding | Severity | Description |
| ------- | -------- | ----------- |
| Missing X-Frame-Options | Medium | Anti-clickjacking header not present |
| Missing X-Content-Type-Options | Medium | MIME type sniffing protection absent |
| robots.txt Entries Accessible | Low | 12+ entries return HTTP 200 instead of 403 |
| Outdated Apache | Medium | Apache/X.X.X outdated (current: 2.4.54+) |
| Junk HTTP Methods Accepted | Low | Server responds to invalid HTTP methods |
| LICENSE.txt Exposed | Info | License file may identify software |

*[Source: scans/nikto.log - lines 10-23 and 37-50]*

###### robots.txt Entries Returning HTTP 200 (Both Hosts)

The following paths should likely return 403 Forbidden but instead return 200 OK:

| Path | Security Concern |
| ---- | ---------------- |
| `/includes/` | PHP include files potentially accessible |
| `/language/` | Language files could reveal version info |
| `/libraries/` | Third-party libraries exposed |
| `/modules/` | XXXXXX modules accessible |
| `/cache/` | Cached data potentially accessible |
| `/layouts/` | Template layouts exposed |
| `/bin/` | Binary/CLI scripts potentially accessible |
| `/tmp/` | Temporary files may contain sensitive data |
| `/components/` | XXXXXX components accessible |
| `/plugins/` | Plugin directory exposed |
| `/administrator/` | Admin interface directly accessible |
| `/cli/` | Command-line interface scripts exposed |

*[Source: scans/nikto.log - lines 12-23 and 38-49]*

##### Wafw00f WAF Detection Results

**Scans Executed:** `wafw00f http://app.inlanefreight.local` and `wafw00f http://dev.inlanefreight.local`
*[Source: scans/wafw00f.log]*

| Virtual Host | WAF Status | Requests Made |
| ------------ | ---------- | ------------- |
| app.inlanefreight.local | **No WAF detected** | 7 |
| dev.inlanefreight.local | **No WAF detected** | 7 |

*[Source: scans/wafw00f.log - lines 18-20 and 38-40]*

**FINDING:** Neither virtual host is protected by a detectable Web Application Firewall. This means:
- No request filtering or rate limiting at the WAF layer
- SQL injection, XSS, and other web attacks would not be blocked by a WAF
- Vulnerability scans and exploitation attempts may not be detected/blocked

*[ANALYSIS: Security implications of missing WAF]*

#### Risk Analysis

The combination of findings from all three tools presents the following risk profile:

1. **Technology Stack Fully Exposed:** An attacker now knows:
   - Web Server: Apache X.X.X
   - Operating System: XXXXXX Linux
   - CMS: XXXXXX!
   - Frontend: Bootstrap, jQuery, HTML5
   - No WAF protection

2. **Attack Surface:** The XXXXXX! directory structure is well-documented, and with no WAF, an attacker could:
   - Probe for known XXXXXX vulnerabilities
   - Attempt brute-force attacks on `/administrator/`
   - Search for vulnerable plugins/components
   - Exploit any Apache X.X.X CVEs

3. **Missing Security Headers:** Both hosts lack:
   - `X-Frame-Options` - Vulnerable to clickjacking
   - `X-Content-Type-Options` - Vulnerable to MIME sniffing attacks
   - `Content-Security-Policy` - No XSS mitigation at header level (not checked but commonly missing)

*[ANALYSIS: Comprehensive risk interpretation combining all scan data]*

#### Recommendation

1. Deploy a Web Application Firewall (ModSecurity with OWASP CRS recommended)
2. Add security headers to Apache configuration:
   ```apache
   Header always set X-Frame-Options "SAMEORIGIN"
   Header always set X-Content-Type-Options "nosniff"
   Header always set Content-Security-Policy "default-src 'self'"
   Header always set X-XSS-Protection "1; mode=block"
   ```
3. Restrict access to sensitive XXXXXX directories at the server level
4. Consider removing or obfuscating the generator meta tag
5. Implement rate limiting for the admin panel
