## Introduction

### Scope and Duration

This penetration testing engagement focused on **Virtual Host (VHost) enumeration** against the target system. The objective was to discover hidden virtual hosts configured on the web server that may expose additional attack surfaces, administrative interfaces, or sensitive functionality not accessible via the primary domain.

**Target System:** 94.237.123.236:54369  
**Primary Domain:** inlanefreight.htb  
**Source:** [tasks.md](tasks.md), Lines 1-3

### Scenarios Included

- **Virtual Host Brute-Force Enumeration** - Systematic discovery of virtual hosts using dictionary-based subdomain enumeration against the target web server's Host header.

### Targets

| Target | IP Address | Port | Domain |
| ------ | ---------- | ---- | ------ |
| Primary Target | 94.237.123.236 | 54369 | inlanefreight.htb |

**Source:** [tasks.md](tasks.md), Line 1

---

## Executive Summary

This assessment successfully identified **seven (7) valid virtual hosts** configured on the target web server at 94.237.123.236:54369. Using Gobuster in virtual host enumeration mode with the SecLists subdomain wordlist, the assessment revealed multiple subdomains that could represent distinct web applications or administrative interfaces.

### Key Findings Summary

| Finding | Subdomain | Response Size | Risk Level |
| ------- | --------- | ------------- | ---------- |
| Interface | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 100 bytes | **High** |
| Portal | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 104 bytes | Medium |
| Application | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 106 bytes | Medium |
| Interface | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 102 bytes | Medium |
| Application | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 100 bytes | Low |
| Platform | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 98 bytes | Low |
| Interface | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | 96 bytes | Medium |

**Source:** [scans/gobuster.log](scans/gobuster.log), Lines 19-26

### Next Steps

*[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]*

The organization should:

1. **Immediately audit** the discovered virtual hosts for authentication requirements and access controls
2. **Review the `XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb` subdomain** as it may expose administrative functionality
3. **Assess each discovered vhost** for vulnerabilities, outdated software, and misconfigurations
4. **Implement DNS/VHost hiding techniques** if these services should not be publicly discoverable
5. **Consider rate-limiting** Host header enumeration attempts

### Caveats

1. This assessment was limited to virtual host discovery only; no exploitation or further enumeration of discovered hosts was performed
2. The scan was executed with 25 concurrent threads, which may not have captured all possible virtual hosts if rate-limiting was in place
3. Results are dependent on the wordlist used (subdomains-top1million-110000.txt); custom or internal naming conventions may not be discovered
4. Four entries returned HTTP 400 status codes (www, mail, smtp, pop3) indicating potential malformed requests or blocked entries

**Source:** [scans/gobuster.log](scans/gobuster.log), Lines 23-26, 28

### Risk Categories and Rationales

| Risk Level | Rationale |
| ---------- | --------- |
| **High** | Administrative interfaces exposed to enumeration; potential unauthorized access vector |
| **Medium** | Application interfaces that may contain vulnerabilities or sensitive data |
| **Low** | Standard web content (blog, forum) with typical attack surface |
| **Informational** | Failed enumeration attempts (HTTP 400) indicating filtering or configuration |

---

## Recommended Actions

| ID | Vulnerability Title | Recommended Action | Risk Category |
| -- | ------------------- | ----------------- | ------------- |
| 1 | Exposed Admin VHost | Implement IP whitelisting or VPN-only access for XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb | High |
| 2 | VHost Enumeration Possible | Configure web server to return consistent responses for invalid Host headers | Medium |
| 3 | Multiple Attack Surfaces | Conduct vulnerability assessment on each discovered virtual host | Medium |
| 4 | Support Portal Exposure | Ensure support.inlanefreight.htb has proper authentication and rate-limiting | Medium |
| 5 | Numbered VHost Pattern | Review naming convention for web17611; sequential numbering may indicate additional hidden hosts | Low |

## Technical Findings

### Section 1: Target Identification and Preparation

#### Background

*[FINDING - Logged Fact]*

The assessment target was defined as IP address 94.237.123.236 on port 54369, associated with the domain inlanefreight.htb.

**Source:** [tasks.md](tasks.md), Line 1

#### Details

Prior to scanning, the following requirements were established:
- Target IP: 94.237.123.236
- Target Port: 54369
- Base Domain: inlanefreight.htb
- Required tool: Gobuster with vhost mode

A subdomains file was prepared containing the target prefixes for validation:
```
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
XXXXXX
```

**Source:** [subdomains](subdomains), Lines 1-5

---

### Section 2: VHost Brute-Force Execution

#### Background

Virtual host (VHost) brute-forcing is a technique used to discover hidden web applications hosted on the same IP address but accessible via different Host headers. Unlike DNS-based subdomain enumeration, VHost enumeration directly queries the target web server with different Host header values to identify valid configurations.

*[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]*

This technique is effective because:
- Many organizations host multiple applications on shared infrastructure
- Virtual hosts may not have public DNS records
- Administrative and internal tools often use VHost-based access control

#### Details

*[FINDING - Logged Fact]*

**Tool Configuration:**
| Parameter | Value |
| --------- | ----- |
| Tool | Gobuster v3.8 |
| Mode | vhost |

### Section 3: Discovery Results and Analysis

#### Discovered Virtual Hosts

*[FINDING - Logged Fact]*

The following virtual hosts returned HTTP 200 status codes, indicating valid configurations:

| Virtual Host | Full Domain | HTTP Status | Response Size |
| ------------ | ----------- | ----------- | ------------- |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 100 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 100 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 98 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 104 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 96 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 102 bytes |
| XXXXXX | XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb:54369 | 200 | 106 bytes |

**Source:** [scans/gobuster.log](scans/gobuster.log), Lines 19-27

#### Failed/Filtered Requests

*[FINDING - Logged Fact]*

The following entries returned HTTP 400 (Bad Request) status codes:

| Virtual Host | HTTP Status | Response Size |
| ------------ | ----------- | ------------- |
| #XXXXXX | 400 | 157 bytes |
| #XXXXXX | 400 | 157 bytes |
| #XXXXXX | 400 | 157 bytes |
| #XXXXXX | 400 | 157 bytes |

*[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]*

The `#` prefix in these entries indicates they are commented entries in the SecLists wordlist. The HTTP 400 responses suggest the server is rejecting malformed Host headers containing special characters.

**Source:** [scans/gobuster.log](scans/gobuster.log), Lines 23-28

#### Risk Analysis

*[ANALYSIS - Expert Interpretation]*

**High Risk -  Interface Discovery:**
The discovery of `XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb` presents a significant security concern.  interfaces typically provide:
- Elevated privileges and functionality
- User management capabilities
- Configuration access
- Potential for authentication bypass vulnerabilities

**Medium Risk - Multiple Application Surfaces:**
Each discovered virtual host represents an independent attack surface that may:
- Run different software versions
- Have varying patch levels
- Implement inconsistent security controls
- Expose sensitive functionality

**Pattern Analysis:**
- `XXXXXX` suggests a numbering scheme that may indicate additional hosts (XXXXXX, etc.)
- `XXXXXX` implies a management interface with potential sequential instances

#### Recommendations

*[RECOMMENDATION]*

1. **Immediate Actions:**
   - Audit authentication mechanisms on XXXXXX.inlanefreight.htb
   - Verify all discovered vhosts are intended to be publicly accessible
   - Review access logs for unauthorized enumeration attempts

2. **Short-term Remediation:**
   - Implement consistent default vhost responses to prevent enumeration
   - Configure rate-limiting for rapid Host header requests
   - Deploy Web Application Firewall (WAF) rules for vhost scanning detection

3. **Long-term Security Improvements:**
   - Consider moving administrative interfaces to separate infrastructure
   - Implement IP-based access controls for sensitive vhosts
   - Establish a vhost inventory and audit process
