# Target: 10.129.201.55

## Questions

*Question 1* - Download the file flag.txt from the web root using wget from the Pwnbox. Submit the contents of the file as your answer.

*Question 2* - Upload the attached file named upload_win.zip to the target using the method of your choice. Once uploaded, unzip the archive, and run "hasher upload_win.txt" from the command line. Submit the generated hash as your answer.

    RDP to with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

*Question 3* - Connect to the target machine via RDP and practice various file transfer operations (upload and download) with your attack host. Type "DONE" when finished.

## Test Playbook

- We are currently working on the Windows File Transfers Test Case.  This can be found at ./cases/file_transfers/windows_file_transfers/*.  Please confirm understanding.

- For this test event, please log all executed commands in program specific log files in the subfolders: 
./cases/file_transfers/windows_file_transfers/scans/* 
Each log file should be named <SCANTOOL>.log.  Whenever a scan tool (nmap, gobuster, telnet, ssh, etc.) is used, a line should be appended to that log file with the full command executed, a line break, and then the results from the command and another line break.  Avoid overloading the target with many simultaneous requests. Please confirm understanding.

- Perform nmap scans against target and save logs:
    - Quick scan for initial services
    - Http enum scans
    - NFS enum scans
    - SMB enum scans
    - RDP enum scans
    - FTP enum scans
    - FTP Anon scans

- Perform Curl scans for headers and content

- Use WGET to download the flag.txt file.

- Start Web server on ATTACK ASSET to allow for payload upload

- Use RDP to connect to the target, then connect via powershell to upload the payload to the target

- Expand the archive, then hash the contents

- Generate a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  
All actions, logs, scans and such are in the folder: ./cases/file_transfers/windows_file_transfers/*
Ensure you read them all as some were generated by me.
Generate as robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the ./cases/file_transfers/windows_file_transfers/* folder and subfolders.  
Fill in details and descriptions and paragraphs as needed from the specific case folder and external research, but do not fabricate any 'facts' without stating so.  Any performance metrics should be found in the logs/scans or not referenced.
For every subsection, or referenced data point, cite which log and where the data came from.
For all infered sections or walkthrough, label them as such.
For all assumed subsections, label them as such.
For all self generated code or actions, label them as such.
Any and all claims must be based in a logged fact/evidence or labeled as inferred/assumed/etc.
Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations.
Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/file_transfers/windows_file_transfers/windows_file_transfers_pentest_report.md
