# Target: 10.129.234.168

## Questions

*Question 1* - Download the file flag.txt from the web root using Python from the Pwnbox. Submit the contents of the file as your answer.

*Question 2* - Upload the attached file named upload_nix.zip to the target using the method of your choice. Once uploaded, SSH to the box, extract the file, and run "hasher <extracted file>" from the command line. Submit the generated hash as your answer.

    SSH to 10.129.234.168 (ACADEMY-MISC-NIX04), with user "htb-student" and password "HTB_@cademy_stdnt!"

*Question 3* - Connect to the target machine via SSH and practice various file transfer operations (upload and download) with your attack host (workstation). Type "DONE" when finished.

## Test Playbook

- Perform nmap scans against target and save logs:
  - Quick scan for initial services
  - Vulnerability Scan
  - Http enum scans
  - SSH enum scans
  - Service/Script scan
  - Top 1000 scan

- Perform Curl scans for headers and content

- Perform Curl scan to get contents of flag.txt file

- connect via ssh and provided credentials to target

- started python http.server on ATTACK asset

- used wget to download the payload from the ATTACK asset to the TARGET asset

- attempted to unzip file, unzip not available on TARGET asset.  no other ZIP binaries found

- started python3, executed following code:

```bash
    htb-student@nix04:~$ python3
    Python 3.8.2 (default, Jul 16 2020, 14:00:26) 
    [GCC 9.3.0] on linux
    Type "help", "copyright", "credits" or "license" for more information.
    >>> import shutil
    >>> zip_file = "upload_nix.zip"
    >>> destination_dir = "."
    >>> shutil.unpack_archive(zip_file, destination_dir)
    >>> exit()
```

- Executed hasher script on output and presented to HTBA Portal:
    htb-student@nix04:~$ hasher upload_nix.txt

## Report Generation Prompt

- We are currently working on the Linux File Transfers Test Case.  This can be found at ./cases/file_transfers/linux_file_transfers/*.  Please confirm understanding.

- We are going to generate a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  Please confirm understanding.

- Generate the Penetration Test Report based on the parsed log and scan files.
Ensure you read them all as some were generated by me.
Generate as robust and technical a report as possible using the parsed information.
Fill in details and descriptions and paragraphs as needed from the specific case folder and external research, but do not fabricate any 'facts' without stating so.  Any performance metrics should be found in the logs/scans or not referenced.
For every subsection, or referenced data point, cite which log and where the data came from.
For all infered sections or walkthrough, label them as such.
For all assumed subsections, label them as such.
For all self generated code or actions, label them as such.
Any and all claims must be based in a logged fact/evidence or labeled as inferred/assumed/etc.
Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations.
Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/file_transfers/linux_file_transfers/linux_file_transfers_pentest_report.md
