- We are currently working on the Footprinting -> DNS Case.  This can be found at ./cases/footprinting/dns/*.  
Please confirm understanding.  please only confirm understanding, we are going to run through this step by step.

- We are going to build a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  Please make sure you read a current copy of that template and confirm you understand.

- All actions, logs, scans and such are in the folder and subolder: ./cases/footprinting/dns/*
Ensure you read them all as we need the current versions used to generate the report.  Confirm you understand.

- Generate a robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the parsed log files following the parsed report template.  Make sure all report sections are created.  The details for each section are embedded in the template.  Do not fabricate any facts without stating so.  All stated facts must be labeled with references to the applicable log files detailed.  Label all sections as coming from the executed logs, or generated by expert, or industry best practice, etc.  Self generated code should also be labeled as such. Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations. Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/footprinting/dns/lab_pentest_report.md
