# Target: 10.129.205.19

## Questions

*Question 1* - Enumerate the target Oracle database and submit the password hash of the user DBSNMP as the answer.

## Test Playbook

- We are currently working on the Oracle Test Case.  This can be found at ./cases/footprinting/oracle/*.  Please confirm understanding.

- For this test event, please log all executed commands in program specific log files in the subfolder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/scans/*.  Each log file should be named <SCANTOOL>.log.  Whenever a scan tool (nmap, gobuster, telnet, ssh, etc.) is used, a line should be appended to that log file with the full command executed, a line break, and then the results from the command and another line break.  Avoid overloading the target with many simultaneous requests. Please confirm understanding.

- Get the health status for the kaliMcp server

- Using kaliMpc, perform a short nmap scan against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an nmap scan pulling versions and banners against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an aggressive nmap scan for ports 1521 against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an nmap scan using all oracle* scripts  against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an ODAT scan against target: 10.129.205.19

- using kaliMpc, enumerate all users with their password hashes against the target: 10.129.205.19. credentials are username "scott" and password "tiger"

- Generate a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  
All actions, logs, scans and such are in the folder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/*
Ensure you read them all as some were generated by me.
Generate as robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the ./cases/footprinting/oracle/* folder and subfolders.  
Fill in details and descriptions and paragraphs as needed from the specific case folder and external research, but do not fabricate any 'facts' without stating so.  Any performance metrics should be found in the logs/scans or not referenced.
For every subsection, or referenced data point, cite which log and where the data came from.
For all infered sections or walkthrough, label them as such.
For all assumed subsections, label them as such.
For all self generated code or actions, label them as such.
Any and all claims must be based in a logged fact/evidence or labeled as inferred/assumed/etc.
Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations.
Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/oracle_pentest_report.md
