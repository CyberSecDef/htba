# Target: 10.129.205.19

## Questions

*Question 1* - Enumerate the target Oracle database and submit the password hash of the user DBSNMP as the answer.

## Test Playbook

- We are currently working on the Oracle Test Case.  This can be found at ./cases/footprinting/oracle/*.  Please confirm understanding.

- For this test event, please log all executed commands in program specific log files in the subfolder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/scans/*.  Each log file should be named <SCANTOOL>.log.  Whenever a scan tool (nmap, gobuster, telnet, ssh, etc.) is used, a line should be appended to that log file with the full command executed, a line break, and then the results from the command and another line break.  Avoid overloading the target with many simultaneous requests. Please confirm understanding.

- Get the health status for the kaliMcp server

- Using kaliMpc, perform a short nmap scan against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an nmap scan pulling versions and banners against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an aggressive nmap scan for ports 1521 against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an nmap scan using all oracle* scripts  against target: 10.129.205.19

- Using kaliMpc, perform an ODAT scan against target: 10.129.205.19

- using kaliMpc, enumerate all users with their password hashes against the target: 10.129.205.19. credentials are username "scott" and password "tiger"

- Generate a Penetration Test Report following the format in ./media/pentest_report_template.md.  
All actions, logs, scans and such are in the folder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/*
make sure you read them all as some were generated by me.
Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/footprinting/oracle/oracle_pentest_report.md
Generate as robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the ./cases/footprinting/oracle/* folder and subfolders.  
Fill in details and descriptions and paragraphs as needed from the specific case folder and external research.
