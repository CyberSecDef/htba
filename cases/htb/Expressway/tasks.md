- Generate a robust and technical a report as possible using the information available in the parsed log files following the parsed report template.  Make sure all report sections are created.  The details for each section are embedded in the template.  Do not fabricate any facts without stating so.  All stated facts must be labeled with references to the applicable log files detailed.  Label all sections as coming from the executed logs, or generated by expert, or industry best practice, etc.  Self generated code should also be labeled as such. Clearly distinguish between findings, analysis/expert interpreation and recomendations. Place the final report in the folder: ./cases/htb/Expressway/expressway_pentest_report.md
