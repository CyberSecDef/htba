## EXECUTIVE SUMMARY

This section provides a high-level, non-technical overview of the penetration testing engagement, suitable for executive leadership and stakeholders without a security background.

The assessment evaluated the security posture of the in-scope environment against real-world attack scenarios. Testing focused on identifying vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized access, data exposure, service disruption, or privilege escalation.

Overall, the assessment identified a combination of low, medium, and high-risk findings. Several issues could be chained together to achieve deeper system compromise if exploited by a motivated attacker.

While no evidence of malicious activity was observed during testing, the presence of exploitable weaknesses indicates an elevated risk profile that should be addressed in a timely manner.

Key recommendations include improving patch management, strengthening access controls, and enhancing monitoring and detection capabilities.

### SCENARIOS INCLUDED

Individual scenarios completed within this event.

* *External Network Penetration Test* – Assessment of externally exposed systems and services from an unauthenticated attacker perspective.
* *Internal Network Penetration Test* – Evaluation of internal systems assuming an attacker has gained initial network access.
* *Credentialed Testing* – Targeted testing using provided credentials to evaluate privilege boundaries and lateral movement risks.
* *Hardware Asset Testing* – Analysis of network-connected hardware for misconfigurations, outdated firmware, or exposed management interfaces.

### APPROACH

The assessment followed an industry-recognized penetration testing methodology combining automated tooling with manual validation and exploitation.

Testing was conducted in phased stages, including reconnaissance, enumeration, vulnerability identification, exploitation, and post-exploitation analysis.

All findings were manually verified to reduce false positives. Exploitation activities were carefully controlled to avoid service disruption and data loss.

Where possible, attack paths were chained to demonstrate realistic risk rather than isolated theoretical vulnerabilities.

### SCOPE AND DURATION

| Host/IP/URL | Duration | Description |
| ----------- | -------- | ----------- |
|             |          |             |
|             |          |             |

Systems explicitly listed were considered in-scope. Any systems not listed were excluded unless otherwise approved in writing.

### ASSESSMENT OVERVIEW AND RECOMMENDATIONS

The assessment revealed several recurring themes, including insufficient patch hygiene, overly permissive access controls, and inconsistent security hardening across systems.

Multiple vulnerabilities were identified that, while individually moderate, could be combined to achieve high-impact outcomes.

The organization would benefit from adopting a risk-based remediation strategy, prioritizing vulnerabilities that enable lateral movement or privilege escalation.

Improvements to logging, alerting, and centralized monitoring would significantly reduce attacker dwell time.

Formalizing secure configuration baselines and enforcing them via automation is strongly recommended.

Regular penetration testing and continuous vulnerability management should be incorporated into the organization’s security lifecycle.

## NETWORK PENETRATION TEST ASSESSMENT SUMMARY

This section summarizes findings related specifically to network-level testing, including exposed services, protocol weaknesses, and segmentation issues.

### SUMMARY OF FINDINGS

* Insecure or outdated network services were identified on multiple hosts.
* Weak network segmentation allowed for broader access than intended.
* Legacy protocols and configurations increased attack surface.
* Firewall rules were overly permissive in certain areas.

## INTERNAL NETWORK COMPROMISE WALKTHROUGH

This section documents a representative attack path demonstrating how an attacker could progress through the environment.

### DETAILED WALKTHROUGH

The compromise scenario began with access to an internal network segment, simulating a phishing or rogue device scenario.

Initial enumeration identified multiple hosts with exposed services and weak authentication mechanisms.

Credential harvesting techniques allowed for lateral movement to additional systems.

Privilege escalation was achieved through misconfigured services and excessive permissions.

The walkthrough demonstrates how individual findings can be chained to produce a high-impact compromise.

## REMEDIATION SUMMARY

This section provides a prioritized remediation roadmap based on risk and implementation effort.

### SHORT TERM

Actions that can be completed within 0–30 days.

* Patch critical vulnerabilities.

* Implement network segmentation improvements.
* Harden system configurations using benchmarks.
* Review and reduce excessive permissions.
* Enhance logging and alerting coverage.

### LONG TERM
