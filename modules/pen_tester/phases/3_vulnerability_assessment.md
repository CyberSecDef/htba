# Vulnerability Assessment Phase Summary

Vulnerability Assessment analyzes data from Information Gathering to identify and evaluate potential security weaknesses. It's an analytical process using descriptive, diagnostic, predictive, and prescriptive analysis. Iterative with Info Gathering; return if more data needed. Focus on quality over speed (unlike CTFs).

## Analysis Types

- **Descriptive**: Examines data sets for characteristics, errors, outliers.
- **Diagnostic**: Identifies causes/effects of conditions via correlations (backward-looking).
- **Predictive**: Uses historical/current data to forecast trends/probabilities.
- **Prescriptive**: Recommends actions to prevent/mitigate issues.

## Drawing Conclusions from Findings

Form hypotheses and test them. Example: Open TCP port 2121.

- What we see: TCP port 2121 (connection-oriented).
- Questions: Is it standard? (No, well-known ports 0-1023). Familiar numbers? (Resembles FTP on 21).
- Test: Connect with Netcat or FTP client to confirm.
- If slow connection (e.g., 15s), adjust scans (e.g., Nmap `--min-rtt-timeout 15`).

**Additional Commands**: `nc -zv targetIP 2121` (Netcat connect test); `ftp targetIP 2121` (FTP connect).

## Vulnerability Research and Analysis

- **Descriptive/Diagnostic**: Identify components; research known vulns (CVEs).
- Sources: CVEdetails, Exploit-DB, Vulners, Packet Storm, NIST.
- Understand POCs; adapt for custom configs.

**Additional Tools/Commands**:

- `searchsploit "service version"` (Search Exploit-DB).
- `cve-search` or online CVE databases.
- Vulners API for automated checks.

## Assessment of Possible Attack Vectors

- **Predictive**: Test based on historical/current data.
- Mirror target locally for evasive testing (avoid alerts).
- Use gathered info to replicate environment.

**Additional Tools/Commands**:

- Nessus/OpenVAS: Scan for vulns (e.g., `openvas-start` then web UI).
- Nikto: `nikto -h targetIP` (Web vuln scan).
- Local setup: Docker for replicating services (e.g., `docker run -p 2121:21 ftpd`).

## Iterative Process

If no vulns found, revisit Info Gathering for deeper data. Overlaps common; prioritize thoroughness to uncover all weaknesses.

**General Tips**: Combine automated/manual testing. Document findings for reporting. For HTB, practice on boxes to build analysis skills. Always scope-check.
