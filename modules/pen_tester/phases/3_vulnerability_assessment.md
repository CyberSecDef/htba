# Vulnerability Assessment Phase

## What Is Vulnerability Assessment?

Think of vulnerability assessment like being a home inspector. You've already mapped out the house (information gathering)—now you need to examine every door, window, pipe, and wire to find weaknesses. Which lock is flimsy? Which window doesn't latch properly? Is there a key under the doormat?

In penetration testing, vulnerability assessment is where you take everything you learned during information gathering and systematically identify security weaknesses that could be exploited.

**Key distinction:**
- **Vulnerability** = A weakness that *could* be exploited (the unlocked window)
- **Exploit** = The method used to take advantage of that weakness (climbing through the window)
- **Vulnerability Assessment** = Finding the weaknesses
- **Exploitation** = Actually using them (next phase)

---

## Why Vulnerability Assessment Matters

This phase bridges the gap between "I know what's there" and "I can break in." Without proper vulnerability assessment:

- You'll waste time trying exploits that won't work
- You'll miss obvious vulnerabilities while chasing complex ones
- You won't understand *why* something is vulnerable
- Your report will lack the depth clients need to fix issues

**The goal:** Build a prioritized list of vulnerabilities to attempt in the exploitation phase, ranked by likelihood of success and potential impact.

---

## Key Concepts

### Vulnerability vs. Weakness vs. Exposure

These terms are often confused. Here's the difference:

| Term | Definition | Example |
|------|------------|---------|
| **Weakness** | A flaw in design or implementation | Using MD5 for password hashing |
| **Vulnerability** | A weakness that can be exploited | MD5 hashes can be cracked quickly |
| **Exposure** | A vulnerability that's accessible to attackers | The MD5 hashes are in a publicly accessible database |

A weakness only becomes a vulnerability when it can be exploited. A vulnerability only becomes an exposure when an attacker can reach it.

### The CVE System

CVE (Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures) is the standardized naming system for publicly known vulnerabilities.

**CVE format:** `CVE-YEAR-NUMBER`

**Example:** `CVE-2021-44228` (Log4Shell)

**What a CVE tells you:**
- The vulnerability is publicly known
- It has been documented and catalogued
- There's likely information about how to exploit it
- There may be patches or mitigations available

> **Note:** Not all vulnerabilities have CVEs. Misconfigurations, weak passwords, and logic flaws often don't have CVE numbers but are still exploitable.

### CVSS: Measuring Severity

CVSS (Common Vulnerability Scoring System) rates vulnerabilities on a 0-10 scale.

| Score | Severity | What It Means |
|-------|----------|---------------|
| 0.0 | None | Not a vulnerability |
| 0.1 - 3.9 | Low | Minor issue, limited impact |
| 4.0 - 6.9 | Medium | Significant issue, moderate impact |
| 7.0 - 8.9 | High | Serious issue, major impact |
| 9.0 - 10.0 | Critical | Severe issue, catastrophic impact |

**CVSS considers:**
- **Attack Vector** - Network, adjacent, local, or physical access required?
- **Attack Complexity** - Easy or difficult to exploit?
- **Privileges Required** - None, low, or high privileges needed?
- **User Interaction** - Does someone need to click something?
- **Impact** - Confidentiality, integrity, availability effects?

**Example:** Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) scored 10.0 because:
- Network accessible (no physical access needed)
- Low complexity (easy to exploit)
- No privileges required
- No user interaction needed
- Complete system compromise possible

### Types of Vulnerabilities

Vulnerabilities fall into several categories:

#### Software Vulnerabilities

Bugs in code that can be exploited.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Buffer Overflow** | Writing data beyond allocated memory | Classic stack smashing |
| **SQL Injection** | Inserting SQL commands through user input | `' OR '1'='1` |
| **Command Injection** | Inserting OS commands through user input | `; cat /etc/passwd` |
| **Path Traversal** | Accessing files outside intended directory | `../../etc/passwd` |
| **Deserialization** | Exploiting object deserialization | Java/PHP object injection |

#### Configuration Vulnerabilities

Secure software configured insecurely.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Default Credentials** | Factory passwords never changed | admin/admin |
| **Unnecessary Services** | Services running that shouldn't be | Telnet on a web server |
| **Overly Permissive Access** | Too many permissions granted | World-readable sensitive files |
| **Missing Security Headers** | Web security features not enabled | No HTTPS, missing CSP |
| **Debug Mode Enabled** | Development settings in production | Stack traces visible |

#### Cryptographic Vulnerabilities

Weak or broken encryption.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Weak Algorithms** | Using broken encryption | MD5, SHA1 for passwords |
| **Short Keys** | Key length too small | 512-bit RSA |
| **Poor Implementation** | Correct algorithm used wrong | Predictable IVs |
| **Missing Encryption** | Sensitive data unencrypted | Passwords in plaintext |

#### Authentication/Authorization Vulnerabilities

Flaws in identity and access control.

| Type | Description | Example |
|------|-------------|---------|
| **Weak Passwords** | Easily guessable credentials | password123 |
| **Missing Authentication** | No login required | Admin panel without auth |
| **Broken Access Control** | Can access others' data | IDOR (changing user ID in URL) |
| **Session Issues** | Poor session management | Predictable session tokens |

```

Let's walk through each step.

---

## Step 1: Review Information Gathering Results

Before running any scanners, review what you already know. Your information gathering phase produced:

- List of hosts and IP addresses
- Open ports and services
- Software versions
- Technology stack
- Potential usernames
- Organizational information

**What to look for:**

| Finding | Potential Vulnerability |
|---------|------------------------|
| Old software versions | Known CVEs |
| Non-standard ports | Hidden/forgotten services |
| Admin interfaces | Authentication weaknesses |
| Development environments | Debug features, weak security |
| Multiple technologies | Larger attack surface |
| Default page titles | Default configurations |

**Example analysis:**

```
Finding: Apache 2.4.49 on port 80
Question: Are there known vulnerabilities?
Research: CVE-2021-41773 - Path traversal and RCE
Result: HIGH PRIORITY - Critical vulnerability with public exploit
```

```
Finding: SSH on port 22, OpenSSH 8.9
Question: Are there known vulnerabilities?
Research: No critical CVEs for this version
Result: LOW PRIORITY - Focus on credential attacks instead
```

---

## Step 2: Automated Vulnerability Scanning

Automated scanners check for thousands of known vulnerabilities quickly. They're your first pass—efficient but not comprehensive.

### Understanding Scanner Types

| Scanner Type | What It Does | Examples |
|--------------|--------------|----------|
| **Network Vulnerability Scanner** | Scans hosts for known vulns | Nessus, OpenVAS, Nexpose |
| **Web Application Scanner** | Tests web apps for common flaws | Burp Suite, OWASP ZAP, Nikto |
| **Specialized Scanner** | Focuses on specific technology | SQLmap (SQL injection), WPScan (WordPress) |

### Network Vulnerability Scanners

#### Nessus

Industry-standard commercial scanner (free version available).

```bash
# Start Nessus (if installed)
sudo systemctl start nessusd

# Access web interface
# https://localhost:8834

# Basic scan workflow:
# 1. Create new scan
# 2. Choose template (Basic Network Scan)
# 3. Enter targets
# 4. Configure credentials (optional but recommended)
# 5. Run scan
# 6. Review results
```

**Nessus output includes:**
- Vulnerability name and description
- CVSS score
- CVE references
- Remediation guidance
- Proof/evidence

#### OpenVAS (Greenbone)

Open-source alternative to Nessus.

```bash
# Start OpenVAS
sudo gvm-start

# Access web interface (Greenbone Security Assistant)
# https://localhost:9392

# Default credentials (change immediately):
# Username: admin
# Password: (set during installation)

# Scan workflow similar to Nessus:
# 1. Create target
# 2. Create task
# 3. Run task
# 4. Review report
```

#### Nmap Scripting Engine (NSE)

Nmap includes vulnerability detection scripts.

```bash
# Run all vuln scripts against a target
nmap --script vuln 192.168.1.1

# Run specific vulnerability checks
nmap --script smb-vuln* 192.168.1.1
nmap --script http-vuln* 192.168.1.1

# Check for specific CVEs
nmap --script vulners 192.168.1.1

# Safe scripts only (won't crash services)
nmap --script "safe and vuln" 192.168.1.1
```

**Common NSE vuln scripts:**

| Script | What It Checks |
|--------|----------------|
| `smb-vuln-ms17-010` | EternalBlue (WannaCry) |
| `smb-vuln-ms08-067` | Conficker vulnerability |
| `http-vuln-cve2017-5638` | Apache Struts RCE |
| `ssl-heartbleed` | Heartbleed vulnerability |
| `ssl-poodle` | POODLE attack |

### Web Application Scanners

#### Nikto

Fast web server scanner for common issues.

```bash
# Basic scan
nikto -h http://192.168.1.1

# Scan specific port
nikto -h http://192.168.1.1:8080

# Scan with SSL
nikto -h https://192.168.1.1

# Save output
nikto -h http://192.168.1.1 -o nikto_results.txt

# Tune scan (focus areas)
nikto -h http://192.168.1.1 -Tuning 9  # SQL injection focus
```

**What Nikto finds:**
- Dangerous files/programs
- Outdated software versions
- Server misconfigurations
- Default files and directories
- Interesting headers

#### OWASP ZAP

Full-featured web application security scanner.

```bash
# Start ZAP
zaproxy

# Or headless/daemon mode
zaproxy -daemon -port 8080

# Quick scan from command line
zap-cli quick-scan http://192.168.1.1

# Full scan
zap-cli active-scan http://192.168.1.1
```

**ZAP scanning modes:**
- **Spider** - Crawl the application to find pages
- **Passive Scan** - Analyze traffic without sending attacks
- **Active Scan** - Send attack payloads to find vulnerabilities

#### Burp Suite

Professional web application testing tool.

```bash
# Start Burp Suite
burpsuite

# Configure browser to use Burp proxy (127.0.0.1:8080)
# Browse the target application
# Use Scanner tab for automated scanning
```

**Burp scanning workflow:**
1. Set target scope
2. Spider the application
3. Run active scan
4. Review issues
5. Manually verify findings

### Specialized Scanners

#### SQLmap (SQL Injection)

```bash
# Test URL parameter for SQL injection
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1"

# Test POST parameter
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/login.php" --data="user=admin&pass=test"

# Use captured request
sqlmap -r request.txt

# Enumerate databases if vulnerable
sqlmap -u "http://target.com/page.php?id=1" --dbs
```

#### WPScan (WordPress)

```bash
# Basic WordPress scan
wpscan --url http://target.com

# Enumerate users
wpscan --url http://target.com --enumerate u

# Enumerate vulnerable plugins
wpscan --url http://target.com --enumerate vp

# Enumerate everything
wpscan --url http://target.com --enumerate ap,at,u
```

#### SSLyze/testssl (SSL/TLS)

```bash
# Using testssl
testssl.sh https://target.com

# Using sslyze
sslyze target.com

# Check specific issues
testssl.sh --vulnerable https://target.com
```

---

## Step 3: Manual Analysis

Automated scanners miss things. Manual analysis catches what scanners can't:

- Business logic flaws
- Complex authentication bypasses
- Chained vulnerabilities
- Context-dependent issues
- Custom application flaws

### What to Test Manually

#### Authentication Testing

```
□ Default credentials (admin/admin, root/root, etc.)
□ Weak password policies (can use "password123"?)
□ Account lockout (or lack thereof)
□ Password reset flaws
□ Session management issues
□ Multi-factor bypass
□ Remember me functionality
```

**Testing default credentials:**

```bash
# Common default credentials to try:
# admin:admin
# admin:password
# root:root
# root:toor
# administrator:administrator
# guest:guest
# test:test
# user:user

# Use Hydra for automated testing
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt ssh://192.168.1.1
hydra -L users.txt -P passwords.txt http-post-form "//login.php:user=^USER^&pass=^PASS^:Invalid"
```

#### Authorization Testing

```
□ Access other users' data (IDOR)
□ Access admin functions as regular user
□ Horizontal privilege escalation
□ Vertical privilege escalation
□ Direct object references
□ Forced browsing to restricted pages
```

**Testing IDOR:**

```
# If URL is: /user/profile?id=123
# Try: /user/profile?id=124, id=1, id=0, id=-1

# If API returns: /api/users/123/data
# Try: /api/users/124/data, /api/users/1/data
```

#### Input Validation Testing

```
□ SQL injection (all parameters)
□ Cross-site scripting (XSS)
□ Command injection
□ Path traversal
□ XML/XXE injection
□ Template injection
```

**Basic injection tests:**

```
# SQL Injection tests
' OR '1'='1
' OR '1'='1'--
" OR "1"="1
1; DROP TABLE users--
' UNION SELECT NULL--

# XSS tests
<script>alert('XSS')</script>
<img src=x onerror=alert('XSS')>
"><script>alert('XSS')</script>
javascript:alert('XSS')

# Command injection tests
; ls
| cat /etc/passwd
`id`
$(whoami)
& dir

# Path traversal tests
../../../etc/passwd
..\..\..\..\windows\system32\config\sam
....//....//....//etc/passwd
```

#### Service-Specific Testing

**FTP:**
```bash
# Anonymous login
ftp 192.168.1.1
# Username: anonymous
# Password: (blank or email)

# Check for writable directories
ftp> put test.txt
```

**SMB:**
```bash
# Null session
smbclient -L //192.168.1.1 -N
rpcclient -U "" -N 192.168.1.1

# Check for writable shares
smbclient //192.168.1.1/share -N
smb: \> put test.txt
```

**SNMP:**
```bash
# Default community strings
snmpwalk -v2c -c public 192.168.1.1
snmpwalk -v2c -c private 192.168.1.1
onesixtyone -c community_strings.txt 192.168.1.1
```

---

## Step 4: Vulnerability Research

When you find a service or software version, research known vulnerabilities.

### Research Workflow

```
1. Identify exact version
       ↓
2. Search for CVEs
       ↓
3. Find exploit details
       ↓
4. Assess applicability
       ↓
5. Document findings
```

### Where to Research

| Resource | URL | Best For |
|----------|-----|----------|
| **NIST NVD** | nvd.nist.gov | Official CVE database |
| **CVE Details** | cvedetails.com | Searchable CVE database |
| **Exploit-DB** | exploit-db.com | Exploits and POCs |
| **Vulners** | vulners.com | Aggregated vuln data |
| **Packet Storm** | packetstormsecurity.com | Exploits and tools |
| **GitHub** | github.com | POCs and exploit code |
| **Google** | google.com | "[software] [version] exploit" |

### Using Searchsploit

Searchsploit is a local copy of Exploit-DB.

```bash
# Search for exploits
searchsploit apache 2.4
searchsploit openssh 7
searchsploit wordpress 5

# Search more specifically
searchsploit "apache 2.4.49"

# Exclude results
searchsploit apache 2.4 --exclude="Denial of Service"

# Show full path to exploit
searchsploit -p 50383

# Copy exploit to current directory
searchsploit -m 50383

# Update database
searchsploit -u
```

**Understanding searchsploit output:**

```
---------------------------------------------- -----------------------
 Exploit Title                                 |  Path
---------------------------------------------- -----------------------
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49 - Path Traversal    | multiple/webapps/50383.py
Apache HTTP Server 2.4.49/50 - RCE            | linux/webapps/50406.sh
---------------------------------------------- -----------------------
```

### Reading CVE Details

When you find a CVE, gather:

1. **Affected versions** - Does the target match?
2. **Attack vector** - Network, local, physical?
3. **Prerequisites** - What's needed to exploit?
4. **CVSS score** - How severe?
5. **Available exploits** - Public POC code?
6. **Patches** - Is a fix available (tells you if target is likely patched)?

**Example CVE research:**

```
CVE-2021-44228 (Log4Shell)
├── Affected: Log4j 2.0-beta9 to 2.14.1
├── Vector: Network (remote, no auth)
├── Prerequisites: App must log user input
├── CVSS: 10.0 (Critical)
├── Exploits: Multiple public POCs
└── Patch: Upgrade to 2.17.0+

Assessment: If target uses vulnerable Log4j and logs user input,
this is HIGH PRIORITY for exploitation attempt.
```

---

## Step 5: Validate Findings

Scanners produce false positives. Before adding a vulnerability to your exploitation list, validate it.

### Why Validation Matters

| Scenario | Scanner Says | Reality |
|----------|--------------|---------|
| **True Positive** | Vulnerable | Actually vulnerable |
| **False Positive** | Vulnerable | Not actually vulnerable |
| **True Negative** | Not vulnerable | Actually not vulnerable |
| **False Negative** | Not vulnerable | Actually vulnerable |

False positives waste time. False negatives mean missed vulnerabilities.

### Validation Techniques

#### 1. Version Verification

Scanner says Apache 2.4.49? Verify:

```bash
# Check HTTP headers
curl -I http://target.com

# Check error pages
curl http://target.com/nonexistent

# Use Nmap version detection
nmap -sV -p 80 target.com
```

#### 2. Safe Exploitation Attempts

Try the vulnerability in a non-destructive way:

```bash
# Path traversal - try reading a known file
curl "http://target.com/cgi-bin/.%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/%2e%2e/etc/passwd"

# SQL injection - try causing an error
curl "http://target.com/page.php?id=1'"

# SSRF - try reaching localhost
curl "http://target.com/fetch?url=http://127.0.0.1"
```

#### 3. Local Replication

Set up a local test environment:

```bash
# Pull vulnerable version with Docker
docker run -d -p 8080:80 httpd:2.4.49

# Test exploit against local instance
# If it works locally, likely works on target
```

#### 4. Multiple Tool Confirmation

If one scanner says it's vulnerable, verify with another:

```bash
# Nessus says SMB vulnerable to MS17-010
# Verify with Nmap
nmap --script smb-vuln-ms17-010 192.168.1.1

# Or use Metasploit checker
msfconsole
use auxiliary/scanner/smb/smb_ms17_010
set RHOSTS 192.168.1.1
run
```

### Documenting Validated Vulnerabilities

For each validated vulnerability, record:

```markdown
## Vulnerability: [Name]

**Host:** 192.168.1.1
**Port/Service:** 80/HTTP (Apache 2.4.49)
**CVE:** CVE-2021-41773
**CVSS:** 7.5 (High)

**Evidence:**
- Version confirmed via HTTP headers
- Path traversal confirmed: /etc/passwd readable
- Screenshot: [link]

**Exploit Available:** Yes (searchsploit 50383.py)

**Potential Impact:**
- File disclosure (read sensitive configs)
- Possible RCE if mod_cgi enabled

**Priority:** HIGH
```

---

## Step 6: Prioritize and Plan

Not all vulnerabilities are equal. Prioritize based on exploitability and impact.

### Prioritization Matrix

| | Low Impact | High Impact |
|---|---|---|
| **Easy to Exploit** | Medium Priority | HIGH PRIORITY |
| **Hard to Exploit** | Low Priority | Medium Priority |

### Prioritization Factors

**Exploitability:**
- Public exploit available? (+priority)
- Requires authentication? (-priority)
- Requires user interaction? (-priority)
- Complex prerequisites? (-priority)
- Reliable exploit? (+priority)

**Impact:**
- Leads to code execution? (+priority)
- Provides credentials? (+priority)
- Access to sensitive data? (+priority)
- Enables lateral movement? (+priority)
- Domain admin potential? (+priority)

### Example Prioritization

| Vulnerability | Exploitability | Impact | Priority |
|---------------|---------------|--------|----------|
| Apache 2.4.49 RCE | Easy (public exploit) | High (shell access) | **1 - Critical** |
| Anonymous FTP | Easy (just connect) | Medium (file access) | **2 - High** |
| Weak SSH password | Medium (need wordlist) | High (shell access) | **3 - High** |
| Missing security headers | N/A (no direct exploit) | Low (info only) | **5 - Low** |
| Self-signed SSL cert | N/A (MitM required) | Low (need positioning) | **6 - Info** |

### Creating an Attack Plan

Based on prioritization, create your exploitation plan:

```markdown
## Attack Plan for 192.168.1.0/24

### Phase 1: Quick Wins
1. [ ] Apache 2.4.49 RCE on 192.168.1.10
2. [ ] Anonymous FTP on 192.168.1.15

### Phase 2: Credential Attacks
3. [ ] SSH brute force on 192.168.1.10 (if RCE fails)
4. [ ] SMB password spray on 192.168.1.20

### Phase 3: Complex Exploits
5. [ ] SQL injection on 192.168.1.25 (needs manual testing)
6. [ ] Deserialization on 192.168.1.30 (needs custom payload)

### Phase 4: Post-Exploitation Pivots
7. [ ] Internal scanning from compromised host
8. [ ] Credential harvesting for lateral movement
```

---

## The Iterative Nature

Vulnerability assessment isn't linear. You'll cycle back to information gathering when:

- Scanner finds new hosts or services
- Exploitation reveals new targets
- Initial assessment yields no viable vectors
- You gain access and can scan internally

```

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

| Mistake | Why It's Bad | What to Do Instead |
|---------|--------------|-------------------|
| Trusting scanners blindly | False positives waste time | Always validate findings |
| Skipping manual testing | Miss logic flaws and chained vulns | Combine automated + manual |
| Ignoring "low" severity | Low vulns can chain to high impact | Document everything |
| Not researching versions | Miss known exploits | Always research exact versions |
| Rushing to exploitation | Miss vulnerabilities | Be thorough before attacking |
| Poor documentation | Can't reproduce findings | Document as you go |
| Forgetting scope | Legal issues | Constantly verify scope |
| Only running one scanner | Different scanners find different things | Use multiple tools |

1. **Review before scanning** - Understand what you have before looking for more
2. **Automate first, then go manual** - Scanners for breadth, manual for depth
3. **Always validate** - False positives waste time and credibility
4. **Research everything** - Every version number is a potential vulnerability
5. **Prioritize ruthlessly** - Focus on high-impact, easy-to-exploit issues first
6. **Document thoroughly** - Your future self and your report will thank you
7. **Stay iterative** - Cycle back to information gathering when needed

The best vulnerability assessments aren't the ones that find the most issues—they're the ones that find the *right* issues and provide a clear path to exploitation.
