# Nessus Scan

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

---

## 1. Technical Report: Nessus Scan Configuration & Operation

---

## 1.1 Purpose of a Nessus Scan

A Nessus scan is the **execution phase** of vulnerability scanning, where previously installed plugins and policies are applied against defined targets. This phase converts theory into **actionable findings**, producing vulnerability data that feeds remediation, risk management, or penetration testing workflows .

---

## 1.2 Creating a New Scan

New scans are created by selecting **New Scan** in the Nessus interface. Nessus organizes scan templates into **three primary categories**:

### Scan Template Categories

1. **Discovery**
2. **Vulnerabilities**
3. **Compliance**

Each category targets a different assessment goal, from simple host discovery to deep configuration auditing.

---

## 1.3 Discovery Scans

### Host Discovery

Discovery scans identify:

* Live hosts
* Open ports
* Basic service availability

These scans are commonly used as a **pre-scan reconnaissance phase**.

#### Fragile Devices

Nessus allows optional scanning of fragile devices such as:

* Network printers
* Novell NetWare hosts
* Operational Technology (OT) devices

These options are **disabled by default** because scanning such devices can cause:

* Device crashes
* Unexpected behavior (e.g., printers dumping garbage output)

Leaving these disabled is the recommended default for most environments .

---

## 1.4 Vulnerability Scans

### Basic Network Scan

For this module, the **Basic Network Scan** is used. This scan:

* Identifies common vulnerabilities
* Performs safe service probing
* Provides a balanced signal-to-noise ratio

Targets are specified explicitly. In the lab environment:

* Windows target: `172.16.16.100`
* Linux target: `172.16.16.160`

---

## 1.5 Port Scanning Configuration

Under **Discovery → Port Scanning**, Nessus provides several options:

### Port Scan Scope

* **Common ports**
* **All ports**
* **Custom port ranges**

Choosing broader scopes increases coverage but also:

* Scan duration
* Network noise
* Risk of service disruption

### Host Discovery Methods

Nessus may use:

* TCP
* ARP
* ICMP (with retries)

These methods ensure hosts are detected even in restrictive network environments .

---

## 1.6 Service Discovery

### Probe All Ports to Find Services

Enabled by default, this option:

* Identifies services running on non-standard ports
* Improves vulnerability detection accuracy

**Risk consideration:**
Poorly written services may crash during probing, though modern applications typically tolerate this.

### SSL/TLS Discovery

Nessus also:

* Identifies SSL/TLS services
* Detects expired certificates
* Detects revoked certificates

This is critical for both security and compliance assessments.

---

## 1.7 Assessment Options

### Web Application Scanning

Under **Assessment**, Nessus can scan web applications by:

* Crawling web content
* Testing for common vulnerabilities
* Using custom user-agent strings
* Testing for issues like Remote File Inclusion (RFI)

This enables **lightweight application security testing** without a dedicated web scanner.

---

### Authentication & Brute Force Testing

If credentials are supplied:

* Nessus performs **authenticated scanning**
* Deep system inspection is enabled

If credentials are not supplied:

* Nessus can attempt **brute-force authentication**
* Uses provided username/password lists
* Leverages tools such as Hydra internally

⚠️ **Operational risk:**
Brute-force options can cause account lockouts if not carefully configured .

---

## 1.8 User Enumeration

Nessus supports multiple user enumeration techniques, including:

* SAM Registry
* ADSI Queries
* WMI Queries
* RID Brute Forcing

### RID Brute Forcing

If enabled, Nessus:

* Iterates through a range of Relative Identifiers (RIDs)
* Enumerates domain and local users

Configurable parameters include:

* Start UID
* End UID

This technique is particularly effective against **Windows environments**.

---

## 1.9 Advanced Scan Settings

### Safe Checks

Enabled by default, safe checks:

* Prevent potentially disruptive tests
* Reduce risk to production systems

Disabling safe checks increases detection depth but also **operational risk**.

---

### Performance & Throttling Controls

Nessus can:

* Slow scans during congestion
* Stop scanning unresponsive hosts
* Randomize target order

These options help:

* Prevent denial-of-service conditions
* Reduce scan detectability
* Maintain network stability .

---

## 1.10 Key Operational Takeaways

* Scan configuration directly impacts accuracy and safety
* Discovery ≠ vulnerability assessment
* Authenticated scans provide exponentially more insight
* Aggressive options must be used deliberately
* Nessus is powerful, but misconfiguration can cause outages

---

# 2. Red Team Playbooks

---

## Red Team Playbook 1: Nessus as an Enumeration Engine

**Objective:**
Accelerate environment understanding.

**Approach:**

1. Run Basic Network Scans internally
2. Identify:

   * Open services
   * Outdated software
   * Misconfigurations
3. Pivot into manual exploitation

**Why it works:**
Nessus consolidates reconnaissance that would otherwise require dozens of tools.

---

## Red Team Playbook 2: Credentialed Scan Abuse

**Objective:**
Leverage stolen credentials for maximum visibility.

**Techniques:**

* Run authenticated scans
* Extract:

  * Patch gaps
  * Privilege escalation paths
  * Weak local policies
* Target systems with the highest privilege exposure

---

## Red Team Playbook 3: RID Brute Force as Pre-Exploitation Recon

**Objective:**
Enumerate users silently before credential attacks.

**Workflow:**

* Enable RID brute forcing
* Identify valid usernames
* Use results for:

  * Password spraying
  * Targeted phishing

---

# 3. Blue Team Playbooks

---

## Blue Team Playbook 1: Safe Scan Governance

**Objective:**
Prevent scan-induced outages.

**Controls:**

* Keep safe checks enabled by default
* Restrict aggressive scanning to maintenance windows
* Document approved scan profiles

---

## Blue Team Playbook 2: Detection of Scanner Misuse

**Objective:**
Identify malicious or unauthorized scans.

**Indicators:**

* Unexpected RID enumeration
* Brute-force authentication attempts
* Scans outside approved IP ranges or time windows

Treat scanner misuse as a **security incident**, not a tooling issue.

---

## Blue Team Playbook 3: Scan Result Triage & Validation

**Objective:**
Convert findings into remediation actions.

**Process:**

1. Validate critical findings manually
2. Correlate with CVSS and asset value
3. Patch or mitigate
4. Rescan to confirm resolution
5. Track metrics longitudinally

---

## Blue Team Playbook 4: Hardening Against Scanner Findings

**Objective:**
Reduce future scan noise and real risk.

**Actions:**

* Close unnecessary ports
* Enforce least-privilege authentication
* Disable legacy services
* Harden SSL/TLS configurations

---

## Summary

* Nessus scans are highly configurable and powerful
* Scan type and options dictate both value and risk
* Discovery, vulnerability, and compliance scans serve different goals
* Authenticated scans provide the most actionable insight
* Both attackers and defenders can leverage Nessus—governance matters
