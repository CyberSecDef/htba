# Working with Nessus Scan Output

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

---

## 1. Technical Report: Interpreting and Using Nessus Scan Output

---

## 1.1 Purpose of Scan Output Analysis

The value of vulnerability scanning is not in running the scan—it is in **how the results are interpreted, transformed, and acted upon**. Nessus provides multiple reporting and export mechanisms designed to support:

* Analyst review and validation
* Executive and stakeholder communication
* Integration with other tools
* Long-term tracking and analytics

Improper handling of scan output leads to:

* Noise overload
* Misprioritized remediation
* Poor client communication
* False confidence in security posture 

---

## 1.2 Nessus Report Formats

Once a scan completes, Nessus allows exporting reports in multiple formats, each serving a different purpose.

### 1.2.1 PDF Reports

**Use case:**

* Sharing results with management or non-technical stakeholders

**Characteristics:**

* Clean, static format
* Easy to distribute
* Difficult to customize or analyze programmatically

PDF reports are best used as **appendices**, not as the primary assessment deliverable.

---

### 1.2.2 HTML Reports

**Use case:**

* Analyst review
* Interactive exploration of findings

**Features:**

* Drill-down capability
* Host-centric and vulnerability-centric views
* Direct links to Tenable plugin documentation

HTML reports are useful during **triage and validation**, but still should not be delivered to clients as a standalone assessment result.

---

### 1.2.3 CSV Reports

**Use case:**

* Data analytics
* Tool ingestion
* Remediation coordination

CSV exports allow analysts to:

* Select specific columns
* Import results into platforms such as:

  * Splunk
  * SIEMs
  * Ticketing systems
  * Custom dashboards

This format is ideal when many teams share remediation responsibility or when metrics and trend analysis are required .

---

## 1.3 Executive Summary vs Detailed Reports

### Executive Summary Reports

Provide:

* List of affected hosts
* Vulnerability counts per host
* High-level severity breakdown

Each vulnerability entry includes:

* Severity
* CVSS score
* Plugin ID
* Plugin name

Plugin IDs link directly to **Tenable’s full plugin write-ups**, which include:

* Technical description
* Impact
* Remediation guidance

---

### Detailed / Custom Reports

Used when:

* Analysts need full context
* Validation is required
* Findings are being incorporated into a custom penetration test report

---

## 1.4 Critical Guidance on Report Sharing

> **Nessus reports should never be delivered to clients as the final assessment product.**

They should be:

* Appendices
* Supporting artifacts
* Internal working documents

Clients expect:

* Context
* Risk explanation
* Exploitability analysis
* Business impact

Raw scanner output provides none of that and can easily be misinterpreted .

---

## 1.5 Organizing and Grouping Vulnerabilities

Best practice dictates that vulnerabilities should be **grouped logically** to improve comprehension:

* Group by:

  * Vulnerability
  * Asset
  * Service
* Avoid flat lists sorted only by severity

This approach enables:

* Faster validation
* Clear remediation ownership
* Better risk understanding across systems

---

## 1.6 Exporting Raw Nessus Scan Data

Beyond reports, Nessus allows exporting **raw scan data** for advanced workflows.

### 1.6.1 `.nessus` File Format

* XML-based
* Includes:

  * Scan settings
  * Plugin output
* Ideal for:

  * Archival
  * Tool ingestion
  * Re-analysis

---

### 1.6.2 `.db` File Format

The `.db` export includes:

* `.nessus` file
* Knowledge Base (KB)
* Plugin Audit Trail
* Scan attachments

This format preserves **full scan context** and is preferred for:

* Forensics
* Long-term retention
* Deep analysis

---

## 1.7 Automation via Nessus API

Nessus exposes a REST API that allows automation of many tasks, including report downloads.

Scripts such as **nessus-report-downloader** can:

* Authenticate to Nessus
* Enumerate completed scans
* Export reports in bulk
* Save them programmatically

This capability is essential for:

* Large environments
* Recurring assessments
* CI/CD-style security pipelines .

---

## 1.8 Integrating Nessus Output with Other Tools

Examples include:

* Feeding CSV data into Splunk for correlation
* Passing `.nessus` files into tools like EyeWitness to:

  * Screenshot discovered web applications
  * Add visual context to findings

This integration greatly increases the **practical value** of scan results.

---

## 1.9 Key Operational Takeaways

* Report format selection matters
* Raw scanner output ≠ assessment
* Grouping and context are mandatory
* Automation is essential at scale
* Scan data should fuel remediation—not just reporting

# 2. Red Team Playbooks

---

## Red Team Playbook 1: Mining Scanner Output for Attack Paths

**Objective:**
Convert scan results into exploit chains.

**Workflow:**

1. Ingest CSV or `.nessus` data
2. Identify:

   * Credential exposure
   * Weak services
   * Patch gaps
3. Chain vulnerabilities across hosts
4. Prioritize low-noise, high-impact paths

**Insight:**
Defenders often fix what’s visible—not what’s dangerous.

---

## Red Team Playbook 2: Living in “Informational” Findings

**Objective:**
Exploit overlooked weaknesses.

**Targets:**

* Self-signed certificates
* Legacy protocols
* Informational misconfigurations

These often enable:

* Credential interception
* Downgrade attacks
* Lateral movement

---

## Red Team Playbook 3: Exploiting Scanner Blind Spots

**Objective:**
Operate outside scanner visibility.

**Methods:**

* Business logic abuse
* Abuse of intended configurations
* Temporary state changes reverted after scans

Scanners report **state**, not **intent**.

---

# 3. Blue Team Playbooks

---

## Blue Team Playbook 1: Scan Result Triage Framework

**Objective:**
Separate signal from noise.

**Process:**

1. Validate Critical and High findings manually
2. Correlate CVSS with asset criticality
3. Identify false positives
4. Assign remediation owners
5. Track resolution and rescan

---

## Blue Team Playbook 2: Reporting for Different Audiences

**Objective:**
Communicate risk effectively.

**Approach:**

* Executives → Summarized risk and trends
* Engineers → Detailed remediation steps
* Auditors → Raw evidence and timelines

Never give all audiences the same report.

---

## Blue Team Playbook 3: Scan Data Lifecycle Management

**Objective:**
Ensure traceability and accountability.

**Controls:**

* Archive `.db` files
* Maintain scan history
* Track vulnerability recurrence
* Use metrics to measure improvement over time

---

## Blue Team Playbook 4: Tool Integration & Automation

**Objective:**
Scale vulnerability management.

**Actions:**

* Automate report exports
* Feed results into SIEM or ticketing
* Enforce remediation SLAs
* Alert on regression

---

## Summary

* Nessus output is powerful but raw
* Proper formatting and grouping are essential
* Scanner reports are **supporting evidence**, not final deliverables
* Automation transforms scanning into a program
* Both attackers and defenders can extract value from scan data—governance determines who wins
