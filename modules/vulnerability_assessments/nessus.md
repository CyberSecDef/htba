# Getting Started with Nessus

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

---

## 1. Technical Report: Getting Started with Nessus

---

## 1.1 Purpose of This Section

This section introduces **Nessus**, a widely used vulnerability scanning platform, and walks through the **initial setup process** so practitioners can begin performing vulnerability assessments. The goal is to ensure users understand not just *how* to install Nessus, but *why* each step matters operationally .

---

## 1.2 Overview of Nessus

Nessus is a **host- and network-based vulnerability scanner** developed by Tenable. It is designed to identify:

* Known vulnerabilities (CVEs)
* Missing patches
* Misconfigurations
* Weak security controls

Nessus operates primarily through **non-exploitative testing**, using version detection, configuration inspection, and safe test payloads.

For training and entry-level usage, **Nessus Essentials** is provided as a free version with limitations but real-world scanning capability.

---

## 1.3 Downloading Nessus

To begin, Nessus must be downloaded from Tenable’s official download page. The correct binary depends on the operating system.

In this walkthrough:

* The **Debian (.deb) package** is used
* Target OS: **Ubuntu**

Selecting the correct package is critical to avoid:

* Dependency issues
* Service failures
* Plugin compilation errors

---

## 1.4 Requesting a Free Nessus Essentials License

Nessus requires **license activation**, even for the free version.

Key points:

* Nessus Essentials is free
* Requires registration to receive an **activation code**
* Activation enables:

  * Plugin downloads
  * Scanner functionality

Without activation, Nessus will install but **cannot scan**.

---

## 1.5 Installing the Nessus Package

Once the Debian package and activation code are obtained, Nessus is installed locally using `dpkg`.

Example installation command:

```
dpkg -i Nessus-<version>.deb
```

During installation:

* Nessus core components are unpacked
* Systemd service files are created
* The `nessusd` service is registered

At this stage, Nessus is installed but **not yet running** .

---

## 1.6 Starting the Nessus Service

After installation, the Nessus service must be started manually:

```
sudo systemctl start nessusd.service
```

This launches:

* The Nessus daemon (`nessusd`)
* The web interface backend

Failure to start this service means:

* The web UI will be inaccessible
* Scans cannot be executed

---

## 1.7 Accessing the Nessus Web Interface

Nessus is managed entirely through a **web-based interface**.

Default access URL:

```
https://localhost:8834
```

Important characteristics:

* Uses HTTPS
* Localhost by default
* Port **8834** is standard

This interface is used for:

* Initial setup
* Scan creation
* Reporting
* Configuration management

---

## 1.8 Initial Nessus Setup

During first-time access, users must:

1. Select **Nessus Essentials**
2. Enter the **activation code**
3. Create an **administrative user account**
4. Define a **secure password**

Once completed, Nessus begins **plugin compilation and download**.

---

## 1.9 Plugin Compilation and Updates

Plugins are the core of Nessus functionality.

During this phase:

* Thousands of vulnerability checks are downloaded
* Plugins are compiled locally
* Nessus prepares its scanning engine

This process may take several minutes and **must fully complete** before scans can be run. Interrupting it can result in:

* Incomplete vulnerability detection
* Plugin errors
* Scan failures

---

## 1.10 Post-Setup Capabilities

Once setup is complete, users can begin:

* Creating scans
* Defining scan policies
* Managing plugin rules
* Customizing global settings

The **Settings** page allows configuration of:

* Proxy servers
* SMTP servers (for alerting)
* User and account management
* Advanced UI, scanning, logging, performance, and security options .

---

## 1.11 Hack The Box Lab Environment Note

Hack The Box provides a **pre-configured Nessus VM** for skills assessments.

Key details:

* Nessus is pre-installed
* Targets are already running
* Web access via `https://<IP>:8834`
* Provided credentials:

  * Username: `htb-student`
  * Password: `HTB_@cademy_student!`

This environment allows learners to focus on **usage**, not setup.

---

## 1.12 Key Operational Takeaways

* Nessus setup is straightforward but **order-dependent**
* Plugin compilation is mandatory
* Nessus is a **scanner**, not an exploitation tool
* Proper configuration dramatically affects scan accuracy

---

# 2. Red Team Playbooks

---

## Red Team Playbook 1: Nessus as Reconnaissance Force Multiplier

**Objective:**
Rapidly enumerate known weaknesses in a target environment.

**Approach:**

1. Deploy Nessus internally or via compromised credentials
2. Run authenticated scans where possible
3. Identify:

   * Local privilege escalation paths
   * Outdated services
   * Misconfigurations
4. Pivot to manual exploitation

**Reality:**
Nessus often reveals **more than weeks of manual enumeration**—if credentials are available.

---

## Red Team Playbook 2: Exploiting Scanner Trust

**Objective:**
Abuse environments where scanners are trusted implicitly.

**Techniques:**

* Target systems that allow scanner IPs unrestricted access
* Abuse whitelisted scanning credentials
* Identify credentials reused elsewhere

**Lesson:**
Scanning infrastructure is a **high-value target**.

---

## Red Team Playbook 3: Timing and Evasion Awareness

**Objective:**
Avoid detection during real attacks.

**Insights:**

* Nessus scans are noisy
* Run on predictable schedules
* Produce distinctive traffic patterns

Attackers often operate **between scans**, not during them.

---

# 3. Blue Team Playbooks

---

## Blue Team Playbook 1: Secure Nessus Deployment

**Objective:**
Prevent scanner compromise.

**Controls:**

* Harden the Nessus host
* Restrict access to port 8834
* Enforce strong authentication
* Monitor Nessus logs

---

## Blue Team Playbook 2: Credentialed Scanning Best Practices

**Objective:**
Maximize scan accuracy without increasing risk.

**Actions:**

* Use least-privilege scan accounts
* Rotate scan credentials regularly
* Scope credentials to required systems only

---

## Blue Team Playbook 3: Scan Result Operationalization

**Objective:**
Turn findings into remediation.

**Workflow:**

1. Validate findings
2. Prioritize using CVSS + business context
3. Patch or mitigate
4. Rescan to confirm closure
5. Track metrics over time

---

## Blue Team Playbook 4: Monitoring Scanner Activity

**Objective:**
Detect abuse or misuse.

**Indicators:**

* Scans running outside approved windows
* Credential failures
* Unexpected scan targets

Treat abnormal scanner behavior as a **potential security incident**.

---

## Summary

* Nessus Essentials is a powerful entry point into vulnerability scanning
* Installation and activation are prerequisites for functionality
* Plugin management is central to scan accuracy
* Nessus supports—but does not replace—manual testing
* Secure configuration of the scanner itself is critical
