# Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE) & Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

## Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks

---

## 1. Technical Report

---

## 1.1 Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)

### 1.1.1 Purpose and Scope of OVAL

**Open Vulnerability Assessment Language (OVAL)** is an open, international security standard designed to **describe, evaluate, and report the security posture of systems**. Rather than exploiting vulnerabilities, OVAL enables **deterministic assessment** of a system’s configuration, software state, and patch level.

OVAL is co-supported by the Office of Cybersecurity and Communications within the Department of Homeland Security and plays a critical role in U.S. federal security automation efforts.

OVAL is also a core component of the National Institute of Standards and Technology **Security Content Automation Protocol (SCAP)**, which standardizes how organizations:

* Automate vulnerability management
* Measure system security posture
* Validate compliance with security policies

The public OVAL repository contains **7,000+ reusable definitions**, making it one of the most extensive machine-readable security knowledge bases available.

---

## 1.1.2 OVAL’s Role in Security Automation

OVAL provides:

* A **common language** for encoding system attributes
* A **structured method** for evaluating security posture
* **Vendor-neutral definitions** usable across tools and platforms

This allows security tools to determine **what is wrong**, **where**, and **why**, without active exploitation—an important distinction in regulated or production environments.

---

## 1.1.3 OVAL Assessment Process

OVAL assessments follow a **three-step workflow**:

1. **Identify system configurations for testing**

   * Installed software
   * Configuration parameters
   * Patch levels
2. **Evaluate the current system state**

   * Compare actual system data against OVAL definitions
3. **Disclose results in a report**

   * Human-readable and machine-consumable output

The result categorizes systems into states such as:

* **Vulnerable**
* **Non-compliant**
* **Installed Asset**
* **Patched**

This process supports continuous compliance monitoring rather than point-in-time testing.

---

## 1.1.4 OVAL Definitions

OVAL definitions are written in **XML** and are designed to identify security issues **without exploitation**. This enables organizations to safely assess large environments at scale.

### Four Primary OVAL Definition Classes

1. **OVAL Vulnerability Definitions**
   Identify known vulnerabilities in software or configurations.

2. **OVAL Compliance Definitions**
   Validate system configurations against security policies or baselines.

3. **OVAL Inventory Definitions**
   Determine whether specific software, services, or components are present.

4. **OVAL Patch Definitions**
   Verify whether required patches or updates have been applied.

This approach allows organizations to **correlate vulnerabilities to specific hosts** and prioritize remediation.

---

## 1.1.5 OVAL Identifier Format

Each OVAL component has a globally unique identifier:

```
oval:<organization domain>:<id type>:<id value>
```

### Common ID Types

* `def` – Definition
* `obj` – Object
* `ste` – State
* `var` – Variable

**Example:**

```
oval:org.mitre.oval:obj:1116
```

This strict naming scheme ensures **interoperability across tools and vendors**.

---

## 1.1.6 OVAL in Vulnerability Scanners

Enterprise scanners such as **Nessus** use OVAL definitions to:

* Power compliance templates
* Perform authenticated configuration checks
* Validate patch and inventory data

OVAL-based scans are typically quieter, safer, and more deterministic than exploit-based testing.

---

## 1.2 Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)

### 1.2.1 Purpose of CVE

**Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures (CVE)** is a **public, standardized catalog of security vulnerabilities** sponsored by the Department of Homeland Security.

Each vulnerability is assigned a **unique CVE ID** by a **CVE Numbering Authority (CNA)**. This identifier enables consistent tracking and discussion of vulnerabilities across:

* Vendors
* Security tools
* Researchers
* Enterprises

A CVE entry includes:

* A vulnerability description
* References and advisories
* Vendor acknowledgments

---

## 1.2.2 CVE Assignment Criteria

For an issue to receive a CVE ID, it must:

* Be **independently fixable**
* Affect **one codebase**
* Be **acknowledged and documented by the vendor**

This ensures CVEs represent **real, actionable security issues**, not theoretical flaws.

---

## 1.2.3 CVE Lifecycle and Assignment Stages

### Stage 1: Determine CVE Relevance

The issue must:

* Be exploitable
* Impact confidentiality, integrity, or availability
* Require a code or specification change to fix
* Not already exist in the CVE database

---

### Stage 2: Contact the Vendor

Researchers must make a **good-faith disclosure attempt** to the affected vendor before public escalation.

---

### Stage 3: Identify Appropriate CNA

* Vendor CNA (if the vendor participates)
* Third-party CNA (if vendor does not)

---

### Stage 4: CVE Web Form Submission

If other avenues fail, researchers may submit a request via the CVE web form.

---

### Stage 5: Confirmation

The CVE team acknowledges the request and may request additional details.

---

### Stage 6: CVE ID Assignment

If approved:

* A CVE ID is issued
* The ID is **not yet public**

---

### Stage 7: Coordinated Disclosure

All stakeholders are notified before public release to prevent duplicate CVEs.

---

### Stage 8: Public Announcement

CVE IDs are publicly announced once vendors are prepared.

---

### Stage 9: Enrichment in NVD

The vulnerability is fully documented and maintained by the **NVD**, operated by NIST.

---

## 1.2.4 Responsible Disclosure

Responsible disclosure ensures:

* Vendors have time to develop patches
* Defenders can prepare mitigations
* Attackers are not tipped off prematurely

Failure to follow responsible disclosure can result in **zero-day exploitation**, where no patch or mitigation exists at the time of public awareness.

---

## 1.2.5 CVE Examples

### CVE-2020-5902

* Unauthenticated remote code execution
* Affects BIG-IP TMUI
* Results in complete system compromise

### CVE-2021-34527 (PrintNightmare)

* Windows Print Spooler RCE
* Affects domain controllers and workstations
* Enables full domain compromise

---

## 1.3 Transition to Vulnerability Scanning

CVE and OVAL together provide:

* **What is vulnerable** (CVE)
* **Where it exists and how to detect it** (OVAL)

This sets the stage for hands-on use of vulnerability scanners such as **Nessus** and **OpenVAS**.
