# Technical Report: Assessment Standards for Vulnerability Assessments & Penetration Testing

## 1. Executive Summary

Security assessments—specifically **vulnerability assessments** and **penetration tests**—must align with recognized **standards and compliance frameworks** to be accepted by regulators, legal authorities, and business partners. These standards ensure assessments are **repeatable, defensible, minimally disruptive**, and produce results that can be trusted for risk management and accreditation purposes.

While compliance standards define **minimum requirements**, effective security programs use them as a **baseline**, not a ceiling. Mature organizations balance compliance obligations with **risk-driven vulnerability management** tailored to their unique environments.

---

## 2. Why Standards Matter

Assessment standards exist to:

* Ensure consistent and thorough testing methodologies
* Reduce operational and legal risk during testing
* Provide defensible evidence of due diligence
* Enable third-party validation and accreditation
* Support contractual and regulatory obligations

Without adherence to standards, assessments may be:

* Legally questionable
* Operationally unsafe
* Rejected by auditors
* Ignored by executive leadership

---

## 3. Compliance Standards (Regulatory & Industry)

Compliance standards are typically **externally imposed** and are often prerequisites for doing business in regulated industries.

### 3.1 Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS)

**PCI DSS**

PCI DSS applies to organizations that **store, process, or transmit cardholder data**.

**Key Requirements**

* Internal and external vulnerability scanning
* Segmentation of the **Cardholder Data Environment (CDE)**
* Restricted access to cardholder data
* Continuous monitoring and testing

**CDE Segmentation**
The CDE must be isolated from the rest of the environment to:

* Limit attack surface
* Reduce scope of compromise
* Minimize internal access to sensitive data

**Core PCI DSS Goals**

* Build and maintain secure networks
* Protect cardholder data
* Maintain vulnerability management programs
* Implement strong access controls
* Monitor and test networks regularly
* Maintain an information security policy

---

### 3.2 Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act (HIPAA)

**HIPAA**

HIPAA governs the protection of **Protected Health Information (PHI)**.

**Assessment Requirements**

* Does **not explicitly mandate vulnerability scans**
* Requires:

  * Risk assessments
  * Identification of vulnerabilities
  * Ongoing risk management

Organizations must demonstrate they **understand and manage risks** to patient data, even if formal scanning is not mandated.

---

### 3.3 Federal Information Security Management Act (FISMA)

**FISMA**

FISMA applies to U.S. federal agencies and contractors.

**Key Obligations**

* Documented vulnerability management program
* Evidence of risk management processes
* Protection of confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA)

Assessments must be **traceable, documented, and repeatable**.

---

### 3.4 ISO/IEC 27001

**ISO 27001**

ISO 27001 is a **globally recognized** information security standard.

**Core Focus**

* Establishing and maintaining an **Information Security Management System (ISMS)**

**Assessment Requirements**

* Regular risk assessments
* Quarterly internal and external vulnerability scans
* Continuous improvement cycle

ISO compliance is achieved through **process maturity**, not one-off testing.

---

## 4. Compliance vs. Risk-Driven Security

While compliance is mandatory in many industries:

* **Compliance defines minimum expectations**
* **Risk management defines real security posture**

A compliance-only program often:

* Misses contextual risk
* Focuses on checklist closure
* Produces a false sense of security

Effective vulnerability management considers:

* Business impact
* Threat landscape
* Organizational risk appetite
* Asset criticality

---

## 5. Penetration Testing Standards

Penetration testing must be governed by **clear rules, legal authorization, and defined methodologies** to prevent harm and liability.

### 5.1 Legal & Ethical Requirements

All penetration tests require:

* Written authorization
* Defined scope and exclusions
* Rules of engagement
* Data handling limitations

**Operational Safety Principles**

* Avoid unnecessary system changes
* Minimize data extraction
* Prefer evidence (screenshots/logs) over data removal
* Preserve system stability

---

## 6. Common Penetration Testing Standards

### 6.1 Penetration Testing Execution Standard (PTES)

**PTES**

PTES is a **universal framework** applicable to most penetration tests.

**PTES Phases**

1. Pre-engagement Interactions
2. Intelligence Gathering
3. Threat Modeling
4. Vulnerability Analysis
5. Exploitation
6. Post-Exploitation
7. Reporting

PTES emphasizes **end-to-end realism**, from scoping to business-impact reporting.

---

### 6.2 Open Source Security Testing Methodology Manual (OSSTMM)

**OSSTMM**

OSSTMM focuses on **operational security testing** across multiple domains.

**Five Testing Channels**

* Human Security (social engineering)
* Physical Security
* Wireless Communications
* Telecommunications
* Data Networks

OSSTMM is often used **alongside** other standards rather than alone.

---

### 6.3 NIST Penetration Testing Framework

**NIST**

NIST provides structured guidance aligned with federal security programs.

**NIST Pentest Phases**

1. Planning
2. Discovery
3. Attack
4. Reporting

This framework integrates cleanly with broader **incident response and risk management** practices.

---

### 6.4 OWASP Testing Standards

**OWASP**

OWASP is the **authoritative source** for application security testing standards.

**Key OWASP Resources**

* Web Security Testing Guide (WSTG)
* Mobile Security Testing Guide (MSTG)
* Firmware Security Testing Methodology

OWASP standards are widely used for:

* Web applications
* APIs
* Mobile apps
* Embedded systems

---

## 7. Selecting the Right Standard

The choice of standard depends on:

* Industry requirements
* Regulatory exposure
* System type (network, web, mobile, cloud)
* Organizational maturity

Most professional engagements use **multiple standards simultaneously**, mapping findings across them.

---

## 8. Strategic Takeaways

* Standards provide **credibility and structure**
* Compliance is necessary but insufficient
* Vulnerability management should be **risk-driven**
* Penetration testing must be **safe, scoped, and defensible**
* Mature programs integrate standards, not blindly follow them

---

# Red Team Playbook: Standards-Aware Offensive Operations

## Objective

Conduct realistic testing while remaining legally compliant and operationally safe.

### Key Practices

* Align methodology to PTES / OSSTMM / NIST
* Follow scope rigorously
* Minimize data exfiltration
* Document impact clearly
* Map findings to compliance controls where relevant

### Red Team Insight

Standards don’t restrict attackers—they restrict **sloppy testers**. Mastery of standards enables **more effective and defensible attacks**.

---

# Blue Team Playbook: Defensive Readiness & Compliance

## Objective

Prepare for and extract value from assessments conducted under recognized standards.

### Core Responsibilities

* Maintain evidence of compliance
* Track remediation against control objectives
* Understand assessment methodologies
* Validate findings contextually
* Avoid “checkbox security”

### Defensive Metrics

* Control coverage
* Remediation timelines
* Audit readiness
* Repeat findings rate

---

## Final Takeaway

Assessment standards exist to ensure **trust, safety, and accountability**.
Organizations that treat them as a **foundation for real security**, rather than a paperwork exercise, gain the most value.
