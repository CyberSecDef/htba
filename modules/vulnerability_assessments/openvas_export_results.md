# Exporting the Results (OpenVAS)

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

---

## 1. Technical Report: Exporting and Consuming OpenVAS Scan Results

---

## 1.1 Purpose of Result Exporting

Once an OpenVAS scan task completes, the raw findings live inside the **Greenbone Security Assistant (GSA)** interface. Exporting results transforms those findings into **portable artifacts** that can be:

* Reviewed offline
* Shared with stakeholders
* Ingested into other tools
* Converted into formal reports
* Used for remediation tracking and metrics

The key takeaway is that **scan execution is only half the workflow**; exporting and interpreting results is where operational value is realized .

---

## 1.2 Accessing Scan Reports in GSA

From the **Scans** page:

* Each completed task has an associated **Report**
* Clicking the report opens a multi-tab view showing:

  * Overall results
  * Operating system identification
  * Open ports
  * Detected services
  * CVEs
  * TLS certificates
  * Errors and messages

As shown in the interface screenshots (page 1), the report view allows analysts to pivot between **summary-level insight and host-specific technical detail**.

---

## 1.3 Built-In Report Tabs and Their Use

Within an OpenVAS report, analysts can review:

* **Information** – high-level metadata about the scan
* **Results** – individual vulnerability findings
* **Hosts** – host-centric aggregation
* **Ports / Services** – exposed attack surface
* **Operating Systems** – OS fingerprinting results
* **CVEs / Closed CVEs** – vulnerability mapping
* **TLS Certificates** – certificate issues
* **Error Messages** – scan reliability indicators

These tabs are designed for **interactive analysis**, not long-term storage or client delivery.

---

## 1.4 Export Formats

OpenVAS supports multiple export formats, each suited to different audiences and workflows:

* **XML**
* **CSV**
* **PDF**
* **ITG**
* **TXT**

The export dialog (page 2) allows selecting these formats directly from GSA.

### Key Insight

* **XML is the most powerful and flexible format**
* Other formats are essentially *presentations* of the underlying XML data

---

## 1.5 XML Export: The Canonical Data Format

When exporting results as **XML**:

* All findings are preserved
* Metadata, severity, hosts, and CVEs remain intact
* The file can be parsed, transformed, or re-rendered into other formats

XML is ideal for:

* Automation
* Custom reporting
* Data analytics
* Long-term archival

For this reason, XML should be treated as the **source of truth** for OpenVAS scan data .

---

## 1.6 Converting XML with `openvasreporting`

The module demonstrates using the **openvasreporting** tool by *TheGroundZero* to convert XML into more consumable formats.

### Example Command

```bash
python3 -m openvasreporting \
  -i report-2bf466b5-627d-4659-bea6-1758b43235b1.xml \
  -f xlsx
```

This command:

* Parses the OpenVAS XML
* Generates an **Excel (.xlsx)** report
* Organizes vulnerabilities into structured worksheets

---

## 1.7 Excel Output Structure (From Screenshots)

As shown on pages 3 and 4, the generated Excel file includes:

### Summary Sheet

* Vulnerability counts by severity (Critical, High, Medium, Low, None)
* Number of affected hosts
* Pie charts visualizing:

  * Vulnerability severity distribution
  * Vulnerabilities by family

### Table of Contents (TOC)

* Each vulnerability listed with:

  * Title
  * CVSS score
  * Affected hosts
* Hyperlinks to individual worksheets

### Individual Vulnerability Sheets

* One worksheet per finding
* Includes:

  * Description
  * Evidence
  * Host/port details
  * Severity context

This structure makes the output **manager-readable and analyst-useful** at the same time.

## 1.8 When (and When Not) to Use Each Format

| Format | Best Use Case                              |
| ------ | ------------------------------------------ |
| XML    | Automation, parsing, archival, conversions |
| CSV    | Data analysis, SIEM ingestion, metrics     |
| XLSX   | Management review, remediation tracking    |
| PDF    | Executive summaries, static sharing        |
| TXT    | Quick reference or scripting               |

> Just like Nessus, **raw OpenVAS reports should not be delivered as final client reports**. They are supporting evidence, not conclusions.

---

## 1.9 Key Operational Takeaways

* GSA is for exploration; exports are for action
* XML is the authoritative format
* Converting results enables broader audiences
* Charts and summaries improve risk communication
* Exporting is essential for remediation workflows and metrics

# 2. Red Team Playbooks

---

## Red Team Playbook 1: Mining Exported Scan Data

**Objective:**
Leverage exported scan results to accelerate compromise.

**Workflow:**

1. Obtain XML, CSV, or XLSX scan exports
2. Identify:

   * High-confidence vulnerabilities
   * Repeated weaknesses across hosts
   * Credential-related findings
3. Prioritize exploit chains using host/service overlap

**Insight:**
Exported reports often reveal **patterns defenders overlook**.

---

## Red Team Playbook 2: Targeting Reporting Infrastructure

**Objective:**
Abuse report storage and conversion tooling.

**Targets:**

* OpenVAS report directories
* Shared report repositories
* Systems running conversion scripts

Compromising reporting artifacts can expose:

* Network topology
* Vulnerability prioritization
* Defensive blind spots

---

## Red Team Playbook 3: Living Between Reports

**Objective:**
Evade detection by exploiting reporting gaps.

**Techniques:**

* Make temporary changes reverted before next export
* Abuse systems excluded from reporting
* Target low-severity but high-impact misconfigurations

Scans and reports capture **snapshots**, not continuous reality.

---

# 3. Blue Team Playbooks

---

## Blue Team Playbook 1: Standardized Export Workflow

**Objective:**
Ensure consistent and defensible reporting.

**Process:**

1. Export XML for every scan
2. Generate XLSX for remediation teams
3. Produce summarized PDF for executives
4. Archive raw XML securely

---

## Blue Team Playbook 2: Report Data Governance

**Objective:**
Protect sensitive scan results.

**Controls:**

* Restrict access to exports
* Encrypt stored reports
* Apply retention policies
* Treat reports as sensitive security artifacts

A leaked scan report is effectively an **attack blueprint**.

---

## Blue Team Playbook 3: Remediation Tracking via Excel

**Objective:**
Turn findings into action.

**Approach:**

* Use XLSX sheets to:

  * Assign owners
  * Track remediation status
  * Monitor repeat findings
* Re-export after rescans for comparison

---

## Blue Team Playbook 4: Metrics and Trend Analysis

**Objective:**
Measure security posture improvement.

**Actions:**

* Aggregate CSV/XML data across scans
* Track:

  * Severity trends
  * Time-to-remediation
  * Recurring vulnerabilities
* Report progress to leadership

---

## Summary

* OpenVAS provides rich scan data, but exporting unlocks its value
* XML is the authoritative export format
* Tools like `openvasreporting` enable professional-grade reports
* Excel outputs bridge the gap between technical and business audiences
* Both attackers and defenders can extract insight from exported results—control and context determine the outcome
