# Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

## 1. Technical Report: Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)

### 1.1 Purpose of Vulnerability Scoring

Vulnerability scoring exists to provide **objective, repeatable severity ratings** that allow organizations to:

* Prioritize remediation efforts
* Allocate security resources efficiently
* Communicate risk consistently across technical and non-technical stakeholders
* Compare vulnerabilities across different platforms and vendors

The **Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS)** is the industry-standard framework used for this purpose. Most vulnerability scanners automatically assign CVSS scores; however, penetration testers and security engineers must understand how scores are derived in order to:

* Validate scanner output
* Manually score custom findings
* Justify risk ratings to clients, auditors, or executives
* Adjust severity based on organizational context

CVSS is often used alongside **Microsoft’s DREAD model**, which provides an additional qualitative risk perspective.

---

## 1.2 DREAD Risk Assessment Model

The **DREAD model** is a qualitative risk analysis framework developed by Microsoft. It assigns a score (typically 0–10) across five dimensions to estimate the overall risk of a vulnerability or threat.

### DREAD Factors

1. **Damage Potential**
   Measures the extent of harm if the vulnerability is exploited. High scores indicate catastrophic business, financial, or operational impact.

2. **Reproducibility**
   Assesses how consistently an exploit can be repeated. Reliable exploits score higher.

3. **Exploitability**
   Evaluates the technical difficulty required to exploit the issue, including tools, skills, and access.

4. **Affected Users**
   Estimates the proportion of users or systems impacted if exploitation occurs.

5. **Discoverability**
   Measures how easily an attacker can identify the vulnerability.

DREAD is commonly used for **internal risk prioritization**, while CVSS provides a **standardized external severity rating**. Together, they allow organizations to balance technical severity with business impact.

## 1.3 CVSS Severity Scoring Overview

CVSS categorizes vulnerability severity based on **exploitability** and **impact**. The framework is divided into three metric groups:

* **Base Metrics**
* **Temporal Metrics**
* **Environmental Metrics**

Each group contributes to the final CVSS score, typically expressed on a scale from **0.0 to 10.0**.

---

## 1.4 Base Metric Group

The **Base Metric Group** represents intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that remain constant across environments.

### 1.4.1 Exploitability Metrics

These metrics evaluate the technical effort required to exploit the vulnerability.

* **Attack Vector (AV)**
  Describes how the vulnerability is accessed (e.g., network, adjacent network, local, physical).

* **Attack Complexity (AC)**
  Measures the conditions beyond the attacker’s control that must exist to exploit the vulnerability.

* **Privileges Required (PR)**
  Indicates the level of access an attacker must already possess.

* **User Interaction (UI)**
  Determines whether exploitation requires user participation (e.g., clicking a link).

---

### 1.4.2 Impact Metrics (CIA Triad)

Impact metrics evaluate the **consequences of successful exploitation** using the CIA triad:

#### Confidentiality Impact

Represents unauthorized disclosure of information.

* **High**: Theft of sensitive data such as credentials, encryption keys, or proprietary information.
* **Low**: Exposure of non-sensitive or limited data.

#### Integrity Impact

Measures unauthorized modification of data.

* **High**: Tampering with critical system or business data.
* **Low**: Limited or uncontrolled modifications without significant operational impact.

#### Availability Impact

Evaluates disruption of system or service access.

* **High**: Complete service outage or denial of business operations.
* **Low**: Partial degradation with continued access to some resources.

---

## 1.5 Temporal Metric Group

The **Temporal Metric Group** accounts for factors that may change over time.

### 1.5.1 Exploit Code Maturity

Represents the likelihood of exploitation based on available attack techniques:

* **Not Defined**: Metric is not considered.
* **High**: Reliable, automated exploits exist.
* **Functional**: Public exploit code is available.
* **Proof-of-Concept**: PoC exists but requires modification.
* **Unproven**: No known exploit code.

---

### 1.5.2 Remediation Level

Indicates the availability and quality of remediation options:

* **Not Defined**
* **Unavailable**: No fix exists.
* **Workaround**: Temporary, unofficial mitigation.
* **Temporary Fix**: Vendor-provided temporary solution.
* **Official Fix**: Fully supported vendor patch released.

---

### 1.5.3 Report Confidence

Measures the reliability and accuracy of vulnerability details:

* **Not Defined**
* **Confirmed**: Multiple trusted sources validate the vulnerability.
* **Reasonable**: Partial confirmation with missing reproduction details.
* **Unknown**: Insufficient verification.

---

## 1.6 Environmental Metric Group

The **Environmental Metric Group** adapts the CVSS score to reflect an organization’s specific context.

### 1.6.1 Modified Base Metrics

Organizations may adjust CIA impacts based on business sensitivity:

* **Not Defined**
* **High**: Severe impact to mission-critical systems or customers.
* **Medium**: Significant operational disruption.
* **Low**: Minimal business impact.

This allows organizations to prioritize vulnerabilities that may be technically identical but operationally very different.

---

## 1.7 CVSS Score Calculation

CVSS v3.1 scores incorporate **Base**, **Temporal**, and **Environmental** metrics into a final severity score. Public calculators—such as the one provided by the National Vulnerability Database—are commonly used for accuracy and consistency.

---

## 1.8 CVSS Example

The **Windows Print Spooler Remote Code Execution vulnerability** has a **CVSS Base Score of 8.8**, indicating high severity due to:

* Network-based exploitation
* High impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability
* Minimal user interaction required

---

## 1.9 Transition to Next Topic

CVSS scoring feeds directly into **standardized vulnerability classification systems** used by scanning tools and databases, which will be addressed in the next section.

# 2. Red Team Playbooks (Offensive Use of CVSS)

## Playbook 1: Using CVSS for Attack Prioritization

**Objective:**
Identify high-impact, low-effort attack paths during an engagement.

**Methodology:**

1. Sort findings by CVSS Base Score.
2. Focus on:

   * Network-based attack vectors
   * Low attack complexity
   * No or low privileges required
3. Cross-reference exploit maturity to identify “weaponized” vulnerabilities.

**Tools:**

* Nessus / Qualys / OpenVAS
* Exploit databases
* NVD CVSS vectors

**Operational Notes:**

* CVSS does not reflect business context—manual judgment is required.
* High CVSS ≠ best exploit path in all environments.

---

**Objective:**
Assign defensible severity ratings to vulnerabilities discovered manually.

**Steps:**

1. Identify Base Metrics from exploitation conditions.
