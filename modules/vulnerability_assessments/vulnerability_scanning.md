# Vulnerability Scanning Overview

**Technical Report, Red Team Playbooks, and Blue Team Playbooks**

---

## 1. Technical Report: Vulnerability Scanning Overview

---

## 1.1 Purpose of Vulnerability Scanning

Vulnerability scanning is an **automated security assessment process** used to identify **known or potential weaknesses** across an organization’s attack surface. This includes:

* Network infrastructure (routers, switches, firewalls)
* Servers and workstations
* Operating systems
* Applications and services

The primary goal is **identification**, not exploitation. Scanners detect weaknesses by comparing observed system characteristics against **known vulnerability signatures, misconfigurations, and insecure states** .

---

## 1.2 Vulnerability Scanning vs Penetration Testing

Although vulnerability scanning is often included in a penetration test, the two are **not equivalent**.

### Vulnerability Scanning

* Automated
* Broad coverage
* Focuses on **known vulnerabilities**
* Low risk to production systems
* Requires **human validation** to distinguish:

  * True positives
  * False positives

### Penetration Testing

* Manual and automated
* Exploit-driven
* Focuses on **real-world impact**
* Chains vulnerabilities together
* Demonstrates actual compromise

Vulnerability scanning is frequently used to **accelerate penetration testing**, especially under time constraints, but **cannot replace manual testing** .

---

## 1.3 Static vs Dynamic Vulnerability Tests

Vulnerability scanners typically use a **combination of static and dynamic testing techniques**.

### Static Testing

* Identifies vulnerabilities based on:

  * Software versions
  * Known CVEs
* Does **not verify exploitability**
* Can produce false positives if:

  * Patches are backported
  * Services are hardened

### Dynamic Testing

* Sends **benign test payloads** to targets
* Examples:

  * Weak credential checks
  * SQL injection probes
  * Command injection attempts
* A positive response strongly indicates a real vulnerability

Dynamic tests are **higher confidence**, but still generally non-exploitative .

---

## 1.4 Authenticated vs Unauthenticated Scanning

Organizations are strongly encouraged to run **both** scan types.

### Unauthenticated Scans

* Simulate an external attacker
* Limited visibility
* Identify perimeter-exposed weaknesses

### Authenticated Scans

* Use valid credentials
* Inspect:

  * Patch levels
  * Configuration issues
  * Local vulnerabilities
* Significantly higher accuracy
* Essential for internal security posture assessment

Both scan types should run on a **continuous schedule** and feed into **patch management programs** .

---

## 1.5 Role of Vulnerability Scanning in Patch Management

Vulnerability scanning is not an end goal—it is an **input into patch and configuration management**. Effective programs use scan results to:

* Identify missing patches
* Detect configuration drift
* Validate remediation effectiveness
* Ensure new assets meet baseline security requirements

Without integration into patch management, scanning devolves into expensive noise generation.

---

## 1.6 Common Vulnerability Scanning Platforms

Several commercial and open-source platforms dominate the vulnerability scanning ecosystem.

### Commercial Platforms

* **Nessus**
* **Qualys**
* **Nexpose (Rapid7 InsightVM)**

These tools offer:

* Large vulnerability databases
* Compliance scanning
* Enterprise reporting

### Open-Source Alternative

* **OpenVAS**

Provides:

* Network vulnerability scanning
* Authenticated and unauthenticated scans
* Community-driven vulnerability feeds

---

## 1.7 Nessus Overview

**Nessus Essentials** is the free version of Tenable’s Nessus scanner.

Key characteristics:

* Limited to **16 hosts**
* Reduced feature set
* Intended for:

  * Learning
  * Small environments
  * Proof-of-concept testing

Despite limitations, it performs **real vulnerability detection** and is well-suited for developing scanning proficiency .

---

## 1.8 OpenVAS Overview

**OpenVAS**, developed by Greenbone Networks, is a fully open-source vulnerability scanner.

Capabilities include:

* Network-based scanning
* Credentialed assessments
* Extensive CVE coverage
* Dashboard-based reporting

OpenVAS is commonly used by:

* Security researchers
* Red teams
* Budget-constrained organizations

It provides strong scanning capabilities without licensing costs .

---

## 1.9 Key Limitations of Vulnerability Scanning

* Does not prove exploitability
* Cannot assess business logic flaws
* Relies on known vulnerability databases
* Produces false positives and false negatives
* Requires skilled analysts for interpretation

This reinforces why **human validation is mandatory**.

# 2. Red Team Playbooks

---

## Red Team Playbook 1: Scanner-Driven Reconnaissance

**Objective:**
Rapidly identify exploitable attack paths using vulnerability scanners.

**Steps:**

1. Run unauthenticated scans to identify externally exposed services
2. Identify:

   * RCEs
   * Default credentials
   * Misconfigurations
3. Correlate findings with CVE exploit availability
4. Manually validate high-value findings

**Operational Insight:**
Scanners find **entry points**, not full attack paths.

---

## Red Team Playbook 2: Authenticated Scan Abuse

**Objective:**
Leverage internal visibility gained through credential compromise.

**Techniques:**

* Use stolen credentials to:

  * Perform authenticated scans
  * Identify local privilege escalation paths
* Map vulnerabilities to lateral movement opportunities

**Reality Check:**
Authenticated scans often reveal far more damaging weaknesses than perimeter scans.

---

## Red Team Playbook 3: Scanner Evasion Awareness

**Objective:**
Avoid detection during real-world exploitation.

**Methods:**

* Time attacks outside scanning windows
* Exploit logic flaws scanners cannot detect
* Abuse intended functionality rather than misconfigurations

Scanners detect **known bad states**, not intent.

---

# 3. Blue Team Playbooks

---

## Blue Team Playbook 1: Vulnerability Management Lifecycle

**Objective:**
Turn scan data into real risk reduction.

**Process:**

1. Schedule authenticated and unauthenticated scans
2. Validate findings
3. Prioritize using CVSS + business context
4. Patch or mitigate
5. Rescan to confirm closure

---

## Blue Team Playbook 2: False Positive Management

**Objective:**
Reduce noise and analyst fatigue.

**Actions:**

* Validate findings manually
* Document accepted risks
* Suppress known false positives
* Tune scan policies

---

## Blue Team Playbook 3: New Asset Detection

**Objective:**
Prevent shadow IT exposure.

**Techniques:**

* Continuous network scanning
* Alert on newly discovered hosts
* Enforce baseline compliance immediately

---

## Blue Team Playbook 4: Scanner Security

**Objective:**
Protect the scanning infrastructure itself.

**Controls:**

* Restrict scanner access
* Rotate credentials used for authenticated scans
* Monitor scanner logs
* Treat scanner compromise as a high-impact incident

---

## Summary

* Vulnerability scanning is **automated discovery**, not exploitation
* It complements but does not replace penetration testing
* Static and dynamic tests provide different confidence levels
* Authenticated scans are critical for internal security
* Nessus and OpenVAS are foundational tools
* Human analysis remains indispensable
